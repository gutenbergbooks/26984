<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>WHY NOT?</h3>
</div>

<p>Polly Street drove her little electric down Michigan
Boulevard, with bitterness in her heart.</p>
<p>It was a cold wet day in the early spring of 1920,
and Chicago was doing her best to show her utter
indifference to anyone&#8217;s opinion as to what spring
weather ought to be. It was the sort of day when, if
you had any ambition left after a dreary winter, you
began to plot desperate things.</p>
<p>Polly hated driving the electric&mdash;her soul yearned
for a gas car. Mrs. Street, however, did not like a
gas car without a man to drive it; the son of the family
was in Athens, Mexico, at a coal mine; and Mr. Street,
Sr., considered that his income did not run to a chauffeur
at the present scale of wage. Therefore, Polly
tried to forget her prejudice and to imagine that the
neat little car was a real machine.</p>
<p>Second among her grievances was the fact that this
was Bob&#8217;s wedding day and she, his adored and adoring
sister, was not with him. Bob had been engaged
for some months to a girl in Douglas, Arizona. The
date of the wedding had been set twice and each time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
difficulties in Mexico had made it seem unwise either
that Bob should leave Athens, where he held the position
of superintendent of one of Fiske, Doane &amp; Co.&#8217;s
mines, or that the bride should venture into the disturbed
region.</p>
<p>This time they expected, as Bob wrote, to &#8220;pull it
off on schedule.&#8221; Polly had hoped either to go to
Douglas for the wedding or to have the bride and
groom in Chicago; but Father had been unable to get
away, Mother hadn&#8217;t been well, and the trip had been
given up. Then the young couple planned to go immediately
to Athens without the formality of a honeymoon.
To quote Bob again: &#8220;People go on honeymoons
to be lonesome, and if anybody can find a better
place to be lonesome in than Athens, let him trot it
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third grievance held an element of publicity
particularly galling to a young lady who was known to
her friends not only as a daring horsewoman, a crack
swimmer and a golf champion, but as a bit of a belle
besides. She and Joyce Henderson had agreed a week
ago to break their engagement. The engagement had
been a mistake&mdash;both young people admitted it frankly
to each other. The irritating part of it was that Joyce
was admitting it to the world.</p>
<p>Instead of taking the matter seriously and considering
himself, outwardly at least, as the victim of an unhappy
love affair, Joyce had escorted another girl, who
shall be nameless, for she does not enter this story except
as an element of conflict, to the Mandarin Ball.
Now the Mandarin Ball is not the frivolous affair that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
its name suggests, but a perennial of deep importance,
a function to which young men are in the habit of
taking their wives, their fiancées, or the girls they
rather hope may be their fiancées. It is one of the few
social affairs left of the old order.</p>
<p>Thus you can see that it was a pointed action on
Joyce&#8217;s part; an indication that he regarded himself as
a free man, and after the habit of free men was about
to put on new chains. It was humiliating, to say the
least. During the war the engagement had seemed
quite natural, quite a part of things. All the young
people were engaged&mdash;except those who were married.</p>
<p>&#8220;That, at least, I had sense enough not to do!&#8221;
raged Polly, as she narrowly missed a pedestrian&#8217;s heel.</p>
<p>It is hard for older people to realize how important
it is at twenty-three to be doing exactly what others
are doing; the absolute anguish of being the only man
in the A. E. F. without a wife or sweetheart, or the
only girl at home without a soldier husband or lover.
A bit of such understanding would make clear not only
the number of divorces and broken engagements which
resulted from the war and had their share in the production
of the unrest of the times, but would also elucidate
a good many other happenings to youth.</p>
<p>So much for Polly Street and Joyce Henderson,
who were fortunate enough to find out before marriage
that they were unsuited for each other. Polly, however,
preferred to look upon the dark side. Joyce had
behaved like a cad.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the worst of it is that everybody will say
it serves me right,&#8221; she went on to herself, &#8220;just because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
I&#8217;ve flirted a bit here and there. It&#8217;s not my
fault if people never turn out as I expect them to. I
guess I&#8217;m like Grandfather Street was in his religion.
He thought the Baptists were wonderful until he joined
them and then the Presbyterians looked more interesting
to him. After he&#8217;d been with them a while he
couldn&#8217;t see how anybody could be a Presbyterian, so
he joined the Unitarians. People thought he was a
turncoat, but he wasn&#8217;t&mdash;he was just a sort of religious
Mormon. One church wasn&#8217;t enough for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear, I wish I&#8217;d gone to Douglas alone! Bob
would understand. I believe I&#8217;ll go to Athens. Why
not? It&#8217;s safe enough or Emma&#8217;s parents wouldn&#8217;t
let her go. Of course it&#8217;s a bit soon after their wedding,
but I&#8217;ll be tactful and keep out of their way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The light of determination was in Polly&#8217;s dark eyes.
They were big lovely eyes that looked at you wistfully
from under arched brows. They seldom laughed
or twinkled and the nose that kept them company was
equally sedate, being purely aquiline, but a mouth with
dimpled corners upset the scheme entirely, while
ripples of golden brown hair completed the picture of
a healthy, happy youngster&mdash;not radiantly beautiful
but what people like to call &#8220;winsome,&#8221; which is after
all as good a word as most.</p>
<p>She parked the electric on the Lake Front and
crossed the Boulevard. The policeman on the crossing
nodded to her and she smiled at him. Polly had what
her father called a &#8220;stand in&#8221; with the force. It was
unnecessary, for she was a good driver when her feelings
were not agitated, but there was something about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
policemen that appealed to her. They were so big and
pink and forceful that you felt rather important when
they nodded to you&mdash;a bit after the fashion of a man
who is recognized by the head waiter.</p>
<p>She was still smiling when she entered the building
in which was located a club to which she belonged. It
was a serious-minded club of clever women, and most
people had been amused when Polly Street joined it.
Nobody expected serious-minded things of Polly,
though here and there someone was willing to admit
that she was &#8220;clever enough in her way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finding the writing-room empty, Polly sat down to
write a letter. Several times in her career she had
decided upon courses of procedure which had seemed
to her eminently practical, only to be talked out of
them by her family. This time she would take no such
chances. She would write to Bob, and Bob, being
much like her, understood her&mdash;as well at any rate as
any brother understands a sister. Then she would go
over to the bank and get some money on her Liberty
Bonds. Polly was as usual broke, Mr. Street being a
man who provided credit liberally for his family but
who had learned from experience that money was safer
in his own hands.</p>
<p>A trip to the ticket office to make reservations and
the thing would be done. A vague remembrance that
Mexico was a place which demanded passports upon
entrance came into her mind but was dismissed airily.
Father would attend to that. The fact that Mexico
was a troublous region where an American girl might
meet with a good many disagreeable adventures was as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
airily dismissed. All that anyone needed to go anywhere,
according to Polly&#8217;s simple code, was common
sense and money. The first she had, the second she
intended to get, so why worry?</p>
<p>As she sat at the writing-table a slightly martial air
came over Polly. Bob must be made to understand the
situation. Because a man took it upon himself to
dwell in or on a coal mine, Polly was never quite sure
of the phrase, in the remote Southwest, he was not
absolved from all family duties. The fact that he had
married the handsomest girl in Arizona and was indulging
in a honeymoon need not prevent an oppressed
sister from demanding sympathy. She wrote rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Bob</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s awfully nervy of me to drop in on
you and Emma right at the beginning of your honeymoon,
but I am coming just the same. Joyce Henderson
has behaved atrociously to me. I&#8217;ll explain when I
see you. You needn&#8217;t show this to Emma; you can
read her scraps of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly paused. A mental picture of Emma, demure
and pretty, came before her. Bob Street was a lucky
man to have found a girl like Emma. A dreamy look
succeeded the martial one. Visions of a flower-bedecked
hacienda&mdash;was that what they called them, it
didn&#8217;t sound exactly right&mdash;surrounded by peons dozing
in the sun succeeded the dimpled vision of Emma.
Polly drew her ideas of Mexico entirely from the
movies, Bob&#8217;s short letters being quite lacking in atmosphere.
She saw herself leaning over a balcony,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
listening to the strains of a mandolin, played by a tall,
slim youth, who resembled a composite photograph of
several of her favorite movie idols. Poor Joyce Henderson,
how unimportant he seemed by the side of that
radiant vision! Polly scribbled furiously.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>ATHENS</h3>
</div>

<p>In the northern part of Mexico, in the state of
Sonora, lies the little mining town of Athens, ironically
named by someone whose sense of beauty was offended
by the yellow stretches of desert sand, broken by hills,
dotted here and there by cactus and mesquite, and
frowned upon by gaunt and angular mountains.</p>
<p>Athens, when the mining industry was running full
time, was a busy if not a beautiful spot. Its row of
shacks housed workers, male and a few female, to a
generous number, while its busy little train of cars&mdash;for
Athens owned a tiny spur of railroad connecting
with the neighboring town of Conejo and operated for
reasons germane to the coal industry&mdash;gave it, if you
were very temperamental, something of the air of a
metropolis seen through a diminishing glass.</p>
<p>The plant and offices which boasted two stories, and
the general merchandise store which was long and
rambling, were larger than the shacks; otherwise
Athens was a true democracy. The company house in
which the superintendent, the manager and the chief
engineer &#8220;bached&#8221; only differed from the others by
an added cleanliness, for Mrs. Van Zandt, the energetic
woman who ran the boarding-house, gave an eye to its
welfare. The little houses were arranged in one long
street and that street was Athens.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>Several days after the invasion of Athens suggested
itself to Miss Polly Street in far-off Chicago, a prominent
citizen strode from the offices in the direction of
the boarding-house. He moved with decision, for he
was hungry, and Mrs. Van Zandt was fastidious as to
hours. The office force ate its supper at six, and the
fact that Marc Scott was the assistant superintendent
and, in the absence of the superintendent on affairs
matrimonial, in charge altogether, was no reason in the
eyes of Mrs. Van Zandt why he should be late to his
meals.</p>
<p>Scott paused outside the boarding-house to look into
the distance where an accustomed but always interesting
sight met his eyes. Away in the distance, between
two foothills, appeared the tiny thread of smoke which
marked the approach of the little train from Conejo.
It was fascinating to watch it; at first so indistinct,
then plainer, and finally to see the little engine puffing
its way along, dragging the small cars. There would
be no one on it but the train gang and nothing more
exciting than the mail, but its bi-weekly arrival never
lost interest for Marc Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson&#8217;s late to-night,&#8221; he muttered, and pushed
open the door which led immediately to the dining-room.
Three men had just begun eating. There was
Henry Hard, the chief engineer; Jimmy Adams, the
bookkeeper, and Jack Williams, who ran the company
store; they, with young Street, Scott, the doctor&mdash;who
a month ago had taken an ailing wife back to Cincinnati&mdash;and
the train gang, formed the little group of
Americans who had held the mining camp together.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>While their location had been freer from trouble
than many parts of Mexico, both in regard to bandit
and federal persecution, they had borne a part in the
general unrest. Once the town had been attacked by
Indians; another time, lying in the path of one of
Villa&#8217;s hurried retreats, it had endured a week-end
visit from that gentleman, after which horses and
canned goods had been scarce for a while.</p>
<p>The worst trouble they had had, however, had been
with labor. They worked the mine with Mexicans,
and the Mexicans were an uncertain quantity. Athens
was too far from the border to admit of hiring labor
from the other side and allowing it to go back and
forth, and the men they got were a discouraged lot,
ready to abandon the job for anything that came up,
from joining the newest bandit to enlisting in the army.
Fighting seemed their <i>metier</i> and most of them preferred
it to the monotony of working a mine. A few
who were married and had hungry families stayed
longer than the rest but it was always a problem.</p>
<p>Just now the mine was running three days a week
and no one knew when orders would come to shut
down entirely. There were the usual rumors afloat in
regard to the coming election in July and a good many
people who had seen other elections in Mexico expected
trouble. The Athens people were looking to
Street&#8217;s return for news from headquarters, but already
several days had gone by since the wedding and
they had heard nothing.</p>
<p>The men looked up and nodded as Scott entered and
Mrs. Van Zandt, peering in from the kitchen through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
a square hole which served as a means of communication,
brought him his coffee. Mrs. Van Zandt had a
weak spot in her heart for Marc Scott&mdash;most women
and children had. One did not at first see why. He
was not good looking, except that he was well made
and well kept; not particularly pleasing in his manner,
being given to an abruptness of speech which most
people found disconcerting; and he liked his own way
more than is conducive to social harmony.</p>
<p>He was, however, straight as a die; was afraid of
few things and no persons; and if he liked you, he had
an especial manner for you which took the edge off his
gruffness so that you wondered why you had ever
thought him disagreeable. His hair and skin were as
brown as each other, which was saying a good deal;
his eyes were gray; his teeth white and strong; and he
had the healthy look of a man who lives in the open,
bathes a good deal and does not overeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Late as usual,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Van Zandt, pessimistically,
as she set the coffee down beside him.
&#8220;The less a man has to do in this world, the harder it
seems to be for him to get to his meals on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it the truth?&#8221; remarked Adams, with feeling.
He was a short, chubby youngster, with a twinkling
blue eye. &#8220;If it was me, I could whistle for my
supper, but seeing it&#8217;s him, he gets fed up, the beggar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad about you!&#8221; sniffed Mrs. Van Zandt. &#8220;I
thought you&#8217;d cut out that second cup of coffee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m aiming to cut it out during the heated term,&#8221;
was the cheerful reply. &#8220;There&#8217;s something about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
your coffee, Mrs. Van, that&#8217;s like some folks&mdash;refuses
to be cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; Mrs. Van was not inaccessible to flattery.
&#8220;Dolores,&#8221; this to a black-haired girl whose
face appeared at the hole. &#8220;You can cut the pies like
I told you&mdash;in fours. If that girl stays with me another
month I&#8217;ll make something out of her; but, Lord,
why should I think she&#8217;ll stay? They never do.
Mexicans must be born with an itch for travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I notice,&#8221; suggested Hard, &#8220;that in the haunts of
civilization they are cutting pies in sixes.&#8221; Hard was
a Bostonian&mdash;tall, spare, and muscular. He came of a
fine old Massachusetts family, and his gray eyes, surrounded
by a dozen kindly little wrinkles, his clean-cut
mouth, wide but firm and thin lipped, showed marks
of breeding absent in the other men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, don&#8217;t tell her!&#8221; growled Adams. &#8220;A
woman just naturally can&#8217;t help trying to follow the
styles, and I can use more pie than a sixth, let me tell
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van, having attended to the distribution of the
pie, sat down at the foot of the table for a bit of conversation.
She was a good-looking woman with dark
hair and eyes, and features which, though they were
hard, were not disagreeable. Her figure was restrained
with much care from its inclination to over
fleshiness. Mrs. Van scorned the sort of woman who
let herself get fat and fought the enemy daily. I could
not possibly tell you her age, for no one but herself
knew it. It might be thirty-five and on the other hand
it might easily be ten or fifteen years more.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>She had led a roving life, beginning somewhere in
the Middle West, carrying on for a time in the East,
where it involved a bit of stage life to which she loved
to refer. There had been a short spasm of matrimony,
not entirely satisfactory, the late Van Zandt having had
his full share of his sex&#8217;s weaknesses, and a final career
of keeping a boarding-house in New York. After that
she had drifted West and finally into Mexico. She
had been a veritable godsend to the Athens mining
company which had undergone the agonies of native
cooking until the digestions of the American portion of
the working force were in a condition resembling half
extinct craters.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m wonderin&#8217; is if Bob Street and his girl
got married or not and when they&#8217;re coming home,&#8221;
she remarked as she sat down. One of Mrs. Van&#8217;s
little peculiarities, saved probably from the wreck of
her theatrical career, was a tendency toward calling
people by their first names when they were not there
to protect themselves and sometimes even when they
were.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;ve got any sense at all they&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; said
Scott, placidly. &#8220;This is no time to be bringin&#8217; more
women into the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Williams, a confirmed bachelor.
&#8220;It was good luck the Doc took his wife and kids off
when he did. There&#8217;ll be trouble here when them elections
is held.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick up your skirts and run, Mrs. Van!&#8221; suggested
Adams. &#8220;You may be cooking for a Mexicano
yet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I do he&#8217;ll know it,&#8221; was the prompt reply. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t the runnin&#8217; kind. Anybody who&#8217;s staved off the
landlord in New York as many times as I have ain&#8217;t
going to worry about Mexicans. What I think those
young folks ought to do is to go East for their honeymoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Adams, with a grin. &#8220;It
wouldn&#8217;t look sporting for the Supe to leave his underlings
without protection in such a crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like Bob Street as well as any young chap I
know,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Zandt, meditatively, &#8220;but I
don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;d want him standin&#8217; between me and
Angel Gonzales&mdash;if Angel was much mad.&#8221; Angel
Gonzales was a local bandit; a man of many crimes
and much history. &#8220;But, of course, it wouldn&#8217;t look
well for the Sup&#8217;rintendent to run away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Street&#8217;s not the running kind, either; don&#8217;t fool
yourself about that,&#8221; remarked Scott, quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good kid. I don&#8217;t care if he is a rich man&#8217;s
son,&#8221; said Adams with sincerity. &#8220;If my Dad had
money I wouldn&#8217;t be keeping books, you bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, son, you&#8217;d be playing the ponies up at Juarez,&#8221;
responded Hard, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not ponies, Henry dear, roulette,&#8221; replied Jimmy,
pleasantly. &#8220;Me and Mrs. Van are going to get
spliced just as soon as the Ouija board tells her the
winning system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well for you to make fun of things
you don&#8217;t know any more about than a baby, Jim
Adams.&#8221; Mrs. Van&#8217;s scorn was intense. &#8220;If you&#8217;d
read that article I showed you in the magazine about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
the man that talked to his mother-in-law by the
Ouija&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother-in-law? Great guns, is that the best the
thing can do?&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply was cut short by the entrance of the train
gang, hot and hungry, clamoring for food.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Conejo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sand-storm. Windy as a parson. Say, you fellows
eat up all the pie?&#8221; Conversation was suspended
while the demands of hunger were satisfied, and Scott
distributed the mail which the late comers had brought.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Bob?&#8221; Hard looked up from his Boston
paper as Scott grunted over his letter. Scott nodded
and then as the others looked their curiosity, he read
the brief note aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Scotty</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Have just had a summons from the directors
to go East at once; guess they&#8217;re uneasy about something
they&#8217;ve heard and want first-hand information.
Emma and I are starting for Chicago to-morrow.
Open all mail and wire anything important.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Bob</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I said they&#8217;d ought to do,&#8221; breathed Mrs.
Van, happily. &#8220;Well, that girl&#8217;s got a good husband&mdash;I&#8217;ll
say she has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Directors would be a heap more uneasy if they
knew what we know,&#8221; remarked Williams, sententiously.
&#8220;Hear anything more about the Chihuahua
troops bein&#8217; ordered in, Johnson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; replied the engineer, his mouth full of pie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
&#8220;Everybody crawled into their holes in Conejo.
Didn&#8217;t you never see a sand-storm, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d known he was going to Chicago. I&#8217;d
have asked him to look in on my girl,&#8221; said Jimmy,
folding up his letter. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the way she writes&mdash;all
jazz and picture shows. Some cuss is trying to
cut me out with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More likely she&#8217;s heard about you and the little
Mexican over to Conejo,&#8221; remarked the fireman, unsympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d had her address she sure would have,&#8221;
replied Adams, promptly. &#8220;That Mexican girl&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we remember her. She was a looker but she
used too much powder&mdash;they all do.&#8221; Hard&#8217;s voice
was judicial. &#8220;She always reminded me of a chocolate
cake caught out in a snow-storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush up!&#8221; Mrs. Van&#8217;s voice was tragic. &#8220;Do
you want Dolores to get mad and quit? They&#8217;ve got
their feelings same as we have. I guess I&#8217;ve got to
catch a deaf and dumb one if I want to keep her on
this place!&#8221;</p>
<p>Marc Scott sat in his place, a pile of letters before
him, when the others had gone, and Mrs. Van was
helping Dolores with the dishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mrs. Van, when you get through with those
dishes come outside a minute; I want to talk to you,&#8221;
he said as he threw open the door.</p>
<p>The shack boasted no veranda, but there were three
small steps. Scott seated himself on the top one and
rolled a cigarette. The air was chilly. The sun had
sunk behind the mountains and outlined their rugged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
shapes with golden lines against the purple. Everything
was very still&mdash;there was not a sound except for
the faint strains of the victrola, which Jimmy Adams
always played for an hour after supper. A few figures
moved about in and out of the other cabins; not
many&mdash;for the working force was light these days. A
light in the store showed that Williams was keeping
open house as usual.</p>
<p>The door opened and Mrs. Van came out and sat
beside him on the step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, quietly, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in the deuce of a mess,&#8221; replied Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Indians?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than that&mdash;it&#8217;s a woman, Mrs. Van.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman!&#8221; Mrs. Van was plainly shocked.
&#8220;My land, Marc Scott, you ain&#8217;t been foolin&#8217; with that
heathen in the kitchen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott chuckled. &#8220;Listen, Mrs. Van, I oughtn&#8217;t to
string you like that&mdash;it is a woman, though. You
heard me read that letter of Bob&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said to read the mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and the first one I tumbled into feet foremost
was a confidential one from his sister. She says she&#8217;s
coming down here. She thinks he&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? You mean here? Athens?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she says. The letter&#8217;s been lying over
at Conejo since Tuesday and the chances are she&#8217;s
there by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that ain&#8217;t the worst. It was a confidential letter.
She said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Scott paused in embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not telling you this for fun, Mrs. Van Zandt, but
because I don&#8217;t know what to do. You&#8217;re a lady&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go on, what&#8217;s the matter with you? I guess if
you know it it ain&#8217;t going to hurt me. Has she run off
with somebody, or has her Pa lost his money, or
what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221; Scott fished out Polly&#8217;s letter
apologetically. &#8220;I stopped reading it directly I saw
it was confidential,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but I got this much
at one swallow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Bob</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s awfully nervy of me to drop in on
you and Emma right at the beginning of your honeymoon,
but I am coming just the same. Joyce Henderson
has behaved atrociously to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I read,&#8221; concluded Scott, penitently.
&#8220;Joyce Henderson is the fellow she&#8217;s engaged to&mdash;Bob
told me that. I had to look at the end to see if she said
when she was coming, and by George, if she started
when she said she was going to, she ought to be in
Conejo right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re going to do with her, I don&#8217;t know, do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She and the wedding couple have just crossed each
other!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it. Look here, Mrs. Van, what am I
going to do? If I don&#8217;t look her up, God knows what&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
happen to her over in Conejo, unless she has sense
enough to go to the Morgans. If I do, she&#8217;s going to
raise merry heck because I read that letter about the
fellow jilting her. Now I thought maybe if you&#8217;d let
on that you read it&mdash;a girl wouldn&#8217;t mind another
woman&#8217;s knowing a thing like that as much as she
would a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt surveyed Scott pityingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It always seems so queer to me that a man can
have so much muscle and so little horse sense,&#8221; she
said at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t any use my explaining; you wouldn&#8217;t
get me,&#8221; she went on, impatiently. &#8220;But here&#8217;s something
even you can understand. I&#8217;d look nice opening
the boss&#8217;s mail, wouldn&#8217;t I? Now you&#8217;ve read the
worst of it you might as well dip into it far enough to
find out just when she&#8217;s coming. Somebody&#8217;ll have to
drive over to Conejo for her as long as the machine&#8217;s
busted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read all I&#8217;m going to,&#8221; said Scott, doggedly.
&#8220;You can do the finding out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt grunted, arranged a pair of eyeglasses
which sat uneasily on a nose ill adapted to
them, and glanced at the letter. She gave a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says she&#8217;s going straight to the Morgans&#8217; when
she gets to Conejo. Bob&#8217;s told her about them.
Prob&#8217;ly Morgan&#8217;ll run her over in his car. She ain&#8217;t
very definite about time; don&#8217;t seem to know just how
long she&#8217;ll be detained at the border.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Unless they&#8217;re all fools up there she&#8217;ll be detained
some time,&#8221; said Scott, disgustedly. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go
and get the Morgans on the wire and see if they&#8217;ve
seen anything of her,&#8221; and he strode away toward the
office.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt sat watching him as he swung down
the street. The sun&#8217;s gilding had faded from the
mountains and it was growing dark. Here and there
a star peeped out as though to commiserate Athens
upon its loneliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is lonely,&#8221; Mrs. Van said to herself. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know as I ever felt it so much before. I hope it don&#8217;t
mean that we&#8217;re going to have trouble. Sometimes I
think I must be psychic&mdash;I seem to sense things so.
Wish that girl had stayed at home, but, Lord, I&#8217;d of
done the same thing at her age. That&#8217;s a youngster&#8217;s
first idea when things go wrong&mdash;to run away. As
though you could run away from things!&#8221;</p>
<p>The lady shook her head pessimistically and drew
her sweater more closely about her as the air grew
chillier. A short plump figure with a shawl wrapped
around its head came out from the back of the house
and melted into the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Dolores?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Si. The deeshes all feenish,&#8221; said Dolores,
promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you wash out the dish towels?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Si. All done. I go to bed.&#8221; Dolores disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar,&#8221; breathed Mrs. Van, softly. &#8220;You
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to bed, you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to set and spoon with
that good-looking cousin of yours. Well, go to it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
You&#8217;re only young once and this country&#8217;d drive a
woman to most anything.&#8221; Her eyes twinkled humorously.
When Mrs. Van&#8217;s eyes twinkled you forgot
that her face was hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but they&#8217;re hittin&#8217; it up on Broadway about
this time! Let&#8217;s see&mdash;it&#8217;ll be about eleven&mdash;the theatres
just lettin&#8217; out, crowds going up and down and
pouring into restaurants. Say, ain&#8217;t it queer the difference
in people&#8217;s lives? There&#8217;s them sitting on plush
and eating lobster, and here&#8217;s me looking into emptiness
and half expecting to see a Yaqui grinning at me
from behind a bush! Hullo, you back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott, accompanied by Hard, came down the street
again. Both seemed disturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked the former, grimly. &#8220;She&#8217;s
started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Started?&#8221; Mrs. Van rose. &#8220;What do you mean
by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got Jack Morgan&#8217;s mother on the &#8217;phone,&#8221; said
Scott. &#8220;Seems she&#8217;d been trying to get us. The girl
got into Conejo about six&mdash;just after our train pulled
out&mdash;tried to get us on the &#8217;phone and couldn&#8217;t; so she
got a machine and is on the way over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a machine!&#8221; Mrs. Van gasped. &#8220;Are the
Morgans crazy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack and his wife have gone over to Mescal with
their car and there&#8217;s nobody home but the old lady and
the youngsters. Old lady Morgan&#8217;s deaf and hollers
over the wire so I couldn&#8217;t get much of what she said,&#8221;
continued Scott, ruefully. &#8220;I made up my mind that
she&#8217;d got old Mendoza to bring her over in his Ford.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Guess it&#8217;s up to me to harness up and go over to meet
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so. That girl must be scared to death
if nothing worse has happened to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing worse will happen to her with Mendoza&mdash;unless
he runs her into an arroyo. Mendoza&#8217;s principles
are better than his eyesight. But, believe me,
she deserves to be scared. It might put a little sense
into her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I drive over with you?&#8221; queried Hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you might help Mrs. Van move our things
down to Jimmy&#8217;s. I thought we&#8217;d put her in our
shack, Mrs. Van, and you could come up and stay with
her.&#8221; And Scott swung off into the direction of the
corral.</p>
<p>The other two proceeded to the company house, as
the superintendent&#8217;s quarters were called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the lady, as they began to pack the two
men&#8217;s belongings, &#8220;I expected to get this house ready
for a bride and groom but I must say I wasn&#8217;t looking
for a lone woman. And yet if I&#8217;d had my wits about
me I might have known. Only last night Dolores and
me were running the Ouija and it says&mdash;look out for
trouble&mdash;just as plain as that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t call her anything as bad as that,&#8221; said
Hard, crossing to where the photograph of Polly Street
hung over the fireplace.</p>
<p>The picture showed a small girl, probably about ten
or eleven; a fat little girl with chubby legs only half
covered with socks, and with dimples in the knees; a
little girl with very wide open eyes and a plump face,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
a firmly shaped mouth and a serious expression; a little
girl with frizzly hair and freckles that the photographer
had failed to retouch, in a costume consisting of
a short skirt, middy, and tam-o&#8217;-shanter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call her a trouble maker,&#8221; said Hard,
laughing, &#8220;unless she&#8217;s changed a lot in ten years.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>EN ROUTE</h3>
</div>

<p>To say that the days which followed Miss Street&#8217;s
unconventional decision passed in a whirl is to be both
trite and truthful. In fact, it was not until she had
crossed the border that she found leisure to reflect.</p>
<p>To begin with, the parents had been difficult, as good
parents usually are when youth begins to chafe at restriction,
especially if youth happens to belong to the
weaker but no longer the less adventurous sex. The
Streets were easy-going people who liked to live by the
way. They were not ambitious and they were not adventurous
and they hated letting go of their children.
It was bad enough to have a son marooned in a mining
camp without losing a daughter in the same way.
Only downright persuasion by the daughter, combined
with remembrance of quite unalarming letters from the
son resulted in the desired permission.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, if Emma&#8217;s parents let her go down there,
I suppose we needn&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; said Mrs. Street, who
disliked argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, Emma&#8217;s parents are fools,&#8221; replied
Mr. Street, sternly. &#8220;Or else, like us, they&#8217;ve raised
a daughter they can&#8217;t control.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it that way, Elbridge!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would. You might as well look things in the
face.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, Father, you know Bob&#8217;s part of the country
has been very calm; and I never get a chance to do
anything interesting! You sat down on me when I
wanted to drive a motor truck in France&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Any father can continue this lament from memory.
The discussion had ended as discussions with spoiled
children usually end. There had been a hurried packing
and the familiar trip across the continent. It was
only when she alighted at a border town and after
some anxious hours waiting to have her passports viséd
and her transportation arranged, embarked on the
shabby south-bound train on the other side, that Polly
fully realized the expedition to which she was committed.</p>
<p>Up to this time her thoughts had been of the life she
was leaving, and, it must be admitted, of Joyce Henderson.
From Illinois to Texas she told herself exactly
what she thought of a man who could so boldly
and plainly and with such an evident relief accept his
dismissal at the hands of the girl he had claimed to
love; but by the time the train had jogged through
miles of queer brownish yellow country, dotted with
mesquite and punctured with cactus, relieved here and
there by foothills, and frowned upon by distant mountains,
her meditations assumed a more cheerful complexion.</p>
<p>The outlook, monotonous as it was, fascinated her.
There were adobe houses with brown youngsters playing
in the scanty shade, much as one sees them in New
Mexico and Arizona; there were uprooted rails and the
ruins of burned cars&mdash;evidences of civil war unknown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
on our side of the line. There was a strong wind
blowing&mdash;the early spring wind of the Southwest, but
the sun shone hotly and one felt stuffy and uncomfortable
in the car. The sand which was caught up by
the wind blew in one&#8217;s face and down one&#8217;s throat and
made closed windows a necessity.</p>
<p>There were a good many people traveling, for a
country in a reputedly unsettled condition, Polly
thought, and wished that she could understand the
fragments of conversation that she heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t I take Spanish instead of French at
school? I always seem to have chosen the most useless
things to study! I wish I knew what those two
fat women without any hats on are talking about&mdash;me,
I suppose, for they keep looking over here. That man
is American&mdash;or English. If I were Bob, I&#8217;d amble
over and get up a conversation with him and find out
all the interesting things I&#8217;m missing. I&#8217;ll bet he owns
a mine down here somewhere. How fascinating!&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s imagination immediately forsook the American
and indulged in a rosy picture of herself as the
owner of a mine&mdash;a gold mine&mdash;coal was too unromantic.
She saw herself in a short skirt and a sombrero
superintending the exertions of a number of dusky
workers who were loading neat little gold bars on the
backs of patient burros.</p>
<p>This delightful picture occupied her fully until the
train stopped and she had to get out. This train did
not go all the way to Conejo, but left one at a junction
called Pecos where twice a week if convenient for all
parties a smaller train rattled its way across the plain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
and into the mountains among which Conejo nestled.
It is not necessary to describe Pecos; its only reason
for existence was the fact that it owned and operated
a smelter.</p>
<p>This second train was the shortest that Polly had
ever seen. It consisted of an engine, two coal cars, a
baggage car, and one passenger coach&mdash;this last very
dirty as to floor and windows and very creaky as to
joints. There were on this occasion but four passengers
beside Polly; the two fat ladies, who were, if she
had only known it, members of the first families of
Conejo; an old man who sat in a corner and read a
German paper; and a young Mexican, well dressed and
of a gentlemanly appearance, who sat across the narrow
aisle from Polly, smoking innumerable cigarettes
and glancing at her whenever he thought she was not
looking.</p>
<p>Polly, however, was too much interested in the
changes of scenery to notice anything as ordinary as a
good-looking young man. The country was changing,
gradually, but still unmistakably changing, from a desert,
flat and stifling, to a region of small hills and valleys;
still brownish yellow, but with the monotony of
mesquite varied by live oaks, and in some cases by
shallow little streams along whose banks grew cottonwoods,
their green foliage restful to the eye weary of
desert bareness.</p>
<p>Many of the cacti were in their beautiful bloom and
gave to the country the needed dash of color. Occasionally
one saw small herds of cattle feeding off the
short stubby vegetation. They were drawing near the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
mountains, whose gauntness seemed less when approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re like ugly people&mdash;grow better looking as
you get to know them,&#8221; mused Polly. &#8220;Oh, my gracious,
what&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; The puffing little engine
had given up trying to make the steep grade it had
been negotiating, and had stopped with one last desperate
wheeze. No one seemed surprised. The fat ladies
went on talking and the old man continued to read his
paper. The trainmen were outside, doing something,
Polly couldn&#8217;t make out what, perhaps only talking
about doing something. &#8220;Oh, dear, I wonder what
has happened!&#8221;</p>
<p>In her excitement she must have said it aloud, for
the young man across the way sprang to his feet and
was at her side instantly. A keen observer might have
drawn the conclusion that he had been waiting for
some such opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, señorita, but it is that the engine cannot
make the grade,&#8221; he volunteered, politely, in English
almost without an accent&mdash;or perhaps I should say
with an intonation English rather than American,
though with a slightly Latin arrangement of phrase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; Polly replied blankly. The young
man had been rather sudden, and he continued to stand
in a disconcerting way, hat in hand, in the aisle. He
appeared to be very young, hardly more than nineteen,
Polly thought, and handsome in a dark way. He had
large dark eyes, very white teeth, a smooth olive skin
without the mustache which so many Spaniards wear,
and a rather prominent under jaw and chin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;they take the first car
over to Conejo and then come back for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that they&#8217;ll leave us here,
perched on the side of this hill, while they run off with
the engine?&#8221; demanded Polly, eyeing the trainmen indignantly.
In fact, she was so busy being indignant
with them that she omitted to notice that the young
man had slipped into the seat opposite her. That fact,
however, had not escaped the fat ladies in the rear, one
of whom said to the other in shocked Spanish:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Juan Pachuca!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;I had thought him
in the South.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows where he is? A wicked person, my
dear, a very wicked person. My sister&#8217;s husband says
he will get himself shot before he finishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; said the other, placidly. &#8220;So many
young men are being shot these days. I thought
that young woman was an actress&mdash;now I am sure of
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Juan Pachuca to Polly&#8217;s question.
&#8220;But do not be alarmed. They will come back in a
couple of hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple of hours!&#8221; The girl&#8217;s voice was horrified.
&#8220;But I expected to be in Conejo in a couple of
hours. I&#8217;m in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One should never be in a hurry in Mexico, señorita,
it does not&mdash;what is it you say&mdash;it does not pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently.&#8221; Polly replied coolly, realizing suddenly
that this good-looking boy was regarding the
conversation as a thing established.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>The stranger was correct in his guess. Uncoupled
from the rest of the train, their coach remained poised
uncomfortably half-way up the hill, while the engine,
still puffing and wheezing like a stout man going upstairs,
pulled the open cars and the baggage car up the
grade and, disappearing through a gap in the hill, became
only a faint noise and a trail of thin smoke.
Polly laughed in spite of herself and the young man
responded with a smile that revealed two dazzling rows
of teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mañana</i>!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;So we say down here
and so we do. You find it amusing, señorita, after
your country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s different, you must admit. We at least aim to
reach places on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is the difference&mdash;you aim, we do not,&#8221;
replied the other, thoughtfully. &#8220;Some day&mdash;but perhaps
the señorita will get out and have a breath of
fresh air? There is, alas, plenty of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A mischievous impulse seized the girl. She felt as
she used to feel when as a small, fat, freckled youngster
she had sat still as long as she possibly could in
school and then despite the teacher&#8217;s stern eye her
nervous energy had got the better of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all he&#8217;s only a boy,&#8221; she told herself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet he isn&#8217;t any older than my freshmen cousins.
What&#8217;s the harm?&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside the sun was hot but the wind was fresh and
cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through that cut in the mountains and around a
curve is Conejo,&#8221; said Juan Pachuca, as Polly, glad to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
be out of the hot car, drew long breaths of the splendid
air. &#8220;You have friends there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Conejo? Oh no, my brother lives in Athens.
That&#8217;s where I am going. He is superintendent of a
coal mine there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Athens? That is some distance from Conejo. Of
course your brother will meet you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Polly, with the faith of the
American girl in the male of the species. &#8220;They
have a little coal train that runs to Conejo and he&#8217;ll
probably come in on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you must be Señorita Street?&#8221; mused the
young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Polly dimpled pleasantly. &#8220;You know Bob
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Juan Pachuca&#8217;s dark eyes smiled. &#8220;Not exactly&mdash;but
I have met him. Me, I have a place south of
Conejo&mdash;quite a long way&mdash;I am what you might call
a long-distance neighbor. My name is Pachuca&mdash;Juan
Pachuca.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Are you in the mining business, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now. Oh, I have mining property, but further
south. My people live in Mexico City. In Sonora I
have a small ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak English rather wonderfully, you know,
señor,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;But more like an Englishman
than an American.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very likely. My sister&mdash;she is much older
than I&mdash;married an Englishman, and her children had
English governesses. When I was young I had my
lessons with them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>So from one thing to another the conversation ran,
very much as it does with two young people of any
nationalities, granted a common language. Polly talked
a good deal about Bob. Juan Pachuca seemed interested
in all the details that she could give him about
the mine. His manner was very respectful. If he
had not met many American girls he had evidently
heard much about them, for he did not seem to misunderstand
the situation as many Latins would have
done. Before the girl had realized it the two hours
were over and the little engine reappeared.</p>
<p>Conejo should, I believe, be called a town. The
people who live in it always dignify it by that name
and they probably have a reason for so doing. To
one holding advanced ideas as to towns, it seems at a
first glance to be only a collection of pinkish looking
adobes which on inspection turn out to be a church, a
store, a jail, a saloon, a hotel&mdash;at which no one stays
who has a friend to take him in&mdash;and some private
houses. It is Juarez without the bull ring, the racetrack
or the gambling places.</p>
<p>It is situated rather flatly between two ranges of
mountains and when Polly Street landed there at
about six o&#8217;clock&mdash;a trying hour in itself&mdash;it was in
the grip of a sand-storm. One&#8217;s first sand-storm is
always a surprise. It looks so innocent from behind
a window pane; just sand&mdash;blowing about rather
swiftly, whirling in spirals, beating against the glass,
piling itself up in drifts&mdash;an interesting sight but not a
terrifying one.</p>
<p>Polly had been a little surprised to see the fat ladies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
array themselves in goggles before descending from
the train, and had laughingly refused an offer of his
own from Juan Pachuca, who promptly put them on
himself. But when she alighted from the train onto
the platform which extended from the rear end of the
general merchandise store, and which served as station,
waiting parlor and baggage-room, she gasped in
dismay. It was as though thousands of tiny pieces of
glass had struck her in the face and throat.</p>
<p>Before she could get her breath they struck her
again and again; sharp, vindictive, piercing little particles
they were. She shut her eyes and put her hands
to her bare throat to protect it. Suddenly she felt a
hand on her arm and Juan Pachuca&#8217;s voice said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep them shut and let me lead you. I told you
what sand-storms were&mdash;you&#8217;d better have taken the
goggles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly succumbed and felt herself being led along the
platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, we&#8217;re in the store,&#8221; said the young man.
&#8220;Rather nasty, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Awful! I never felt anything like it,&#8221; gasped the
girl, shaking the sand from her clothes. &#8220;And it
isn&#8217;t sand, it&#8217;s gravel. No wonder you wear goggles!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I find them most convenient for many purposes,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>Polly noticed that he still had them on though they
were in the store. They gave him a queer, oldish appearance
and quite spoiled his good looks. Polly herself
was beginning to feel disturbed. She wanted Bob
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
and she wanted him immediately. She looked about
her anxiously.</p>
<p>The store was larger than it appeared from without
and carried a varied line of goods piled up on shelves
or displayed on counters. On one side, it seemed to
be a grocery store; on the other, dry-goods, shoes, and
hats were set forth, while in the rear were saddles,
bridles and other paraphernalia in leather. A big
stove in the middle of the room gave out a cheerful
warmth, for the air was growing very cool as the sun
went down.</p>
<p>There were a few people, Mexicans and Indians, in
the place and they all stared curiously at the pretty
American. Polly did not realize, though she was not
in the habit of underrating her attractions, how very
noticeable she was in that environment, as she stood
there, her tan traveling coat thrown open showing her
dainty white waist, her short, trim skirt with its big
plaid squares, and her neat brown silk stockings and
oxfords. Conejo had not seen her like in many moons
and it stared its full.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Bob would be at the station. If I could
go there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Polly began, with a little lump in her
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the station,&#8221; said Pachuca. &#8220;It is Jacob
Swartz&#8217; store and the station as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then something has happened to my letter. He
never would have disappointed me like this,&#8221; said the
girl, despairingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is quite possible. If you would let me serve
you in this matter, señorita? I have a car at the house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
of a friend just out of town. I am driving to my ranch
in it to-morrow. If you would let me drive you to
Athens&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive in an open car in that?&#8221; the girl pointed to
the whirling sand outside. &#8220;How could we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easily. Once on our way into the mountains we
will leave it behind us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you very much, señor, you&#8217;re very kind,
but if Bob doesn&#8217;t come I can go to some friends of
his, English people, the Morgans, and they will drive
me over in the morning.&#8221; She was conscious of a
sudden desire to get away from this polite youth who
stuck so tightly. It was all very well to let him amuse
her on the train&mdash;that was adventure; but to drive with
him through a strange country at night would be pure
madness. She thought he stiffened a bit at her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;English people? Oh, yes, undoubtedly that will
be wise. Swartz can probably tell you where to find
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221; Polly was glad to see that he was
going to leave her. &#8220;Thank you again, señor, for
your kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a great pleasure,&#8221; and the young man
was gone.</p>
<p>Polly clenched her hands nervously. Where, oh,
where was Bob? Why hadn&#8217;t she telegraphed instead
of trusting to a letter? At this juncture her glance fell
upon a small counter over which the sign P. O. was
displayed. Behind the counter sat a stout man in spectacles&mdash;Jacob
Swartz, undoubtedly. Polly accosted
him timidly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Has anyone been in from Athens to-day?&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Athens? Sure, dere train come up dis morning;
dey wendt back an hour ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Mr. Street here&mdash;Mr. Robert Street?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, joost the train gang. Dey wendt back when
dey got dere mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do&mdash;do they come every day for the mail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, joost twice a week. Dere mail ain&#8217;t so heavy
it can&#8217;t wait dat long.&#8221; Swartz peered benevolently
over his spectacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mr. Street&#8217;s sister. I wrote him I was coming,
but I suppose if he only gets his mail twice a
week he hasn&#8217;t had my letter.&#8221; Polly bit her lip impatiently.
&#8220;I want to go over to the Morgans&mdash;Mr.
Jack Morgan. Can you show me where they
live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure can I,&#8221; replied Swartz, lumbering to his feet.
&#8220;You can from the door see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly followed him in relief, when suddenly the door
opened and a little old lady literally blew in. She
stamped her feet as though it were snow instead of
sand that clung to her, and disengaged her head from
the thick white veil in which she had wrapped it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mein Gott, it is old lady Morgan, herself,&#8221; said
Swartz, nudging Polly, pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Somebody wanting me?&#8221; replied
the lady, still occupied with the veil. &#8220;Where&#8217;s that
tea I told you to send me this morning, Swartz? A
fine thing to make me come out in all this for a pound
of tea, just because I&#8217;ve nobody to send and two sick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
children on my hands! What? Oh, I can&#8217;t hear you!
Who d&#8217;you say wants me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was a thin, bent old lady with straggly gray hair
and a very sharp penetrating voice. Polly felt the
lump in her throat growing larger. Was this the jolly
pretty Mrs. Jack Morgan that Bob had written about
so often?</p>
<p>&#8220;Dis young voman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Swartz, heavily.</p>
<p>Polly stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Morgan, this is Bob Street&#8217;s sister. He has
often written us about you and your husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Husband? She ain&#8217;t got no husband,&#8221; interrupted
Mr. Swartz, heatedly. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t I told you dis iss de old
lady&mdash;Jack Morgan&#8217;s mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little hard of hearing, my dear. Who did
you say you were?&#8221; asked Jack Morgan&#8217;s mother, patiently.</p>
<p>Polly repeated her explanation, adding a few more
particulars, all as loudly as possible. They had now
an interested audience of Mexicans and Indians, male
and female, old and young, who found the scene none
the less attractive because they did not understand it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose he didn&#8217;t get your letter,&#8221; said
Mrs. Morgan. &#8220;Jack and his wife have gone over to
spend a few days with some friends in Mescal or
they&#8217;d run you over in the car.&#8221; There was a pause
as Polly digested this unwelcome bit of news, then the
old lady continued: &#8220;They&#8217;d only been gone two days
when both the children came down with mumps, and
my Mexican woman&#8217;s husband had to take that time
to join the army, so, of course, she had to leave. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
things weren&#8217;t so messed up I&#8217;d take you home with
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Polly, promptly. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think
of it. If I could just get somebody to drive me
over&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Both she and Mrs. Morgan looked at
Swartz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mendoza might if he ain&#8217;t drunk&mdash;sometimes he
ain&#8217;t,&#8221; volunteered that gentleman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like him,&#8221; shivered Polly.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there anybody else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody with a car,&#8221; replied Mrs. Morgan. &#8220;It&#8217;d
take you till morning to drive over&mdash;the roads are awful.
Mendoza is a very decent old thing. You go
and see if you can get him, Swartz,&#8221; and Swartz lumbered
away. Old lady Morgan understood how to
make herself obeyed. &#8220;Have you tried to get Athens
on the &#8217;phone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Telephone?&#8221; A smile broke over Polly&#8217;s unhappy
face. &#8220;Why, I never thought of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, child, where do you think you are?
Here, I&#8217;ll get them for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way to the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen your brother since he went up to
Douglas to get married,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know
they&#8217;d come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they must be home,&#8221; said Polly, an awful
doubt coming into her mind. &#8220;They&mdash;they must be
home!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morgan seized the receiver and began exchanging
insults with the invisible Central. After several
minutes she gave up the effort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, I can&#8217;t raise them&mdash;our service is
dreadful down here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll tell you
what to do. I&#8217;ve got to run home before the baby
wakes up; if he can&#8217;t get Mendoza, you come on down
to the house and stay the night with me. See, it&#8217;s the
last house&mdash;got a Union Jack flying from it. If I
don&#8217;t see you in half an hour I&#8217;ll know you&#8217;ve gone
with Mendoza. You needn&#8217;t be afraid of him&mdash;he&#8217;s
half dead but he can drive a Ford,&#8221; and the voluble
old lady was gone.</p>
<p>Polly wondered for a moment whether she most
wanted to laugh or cry. Homesickness and fatigue
suggested the latter, but a wild sense of humor
poised between the decrepit Mendoza and the deaf
Mrs. Morgan won the day. Polly chuckled. Then
realizing that it was nearly seven and that she had had
nothing to eat since noon, she went to the counter and
bought of a Mexican youth, evidently a helper, some
crackers. They were in a box and looked a degree
cleaner than anything else. The population had
wearied of the American lady and had gone its various
ways. Polly sat forlornly on a high stool and
munched her crackers until Swartz returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mendoza&#8217;s sick and he
won&#8217;t let nobody else drive de car. You better go
stay mit de old lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the girl, rising. &#8220;I suppose I can
leave my trunk on your back porch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vy not? Ain&#8217;t it der station? Vere should you
leaf it?&#8221; replied Swartz, hospitably.</p>
<p>Polly stepped out of the front door. The sand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
blizzard was undoubtedly on the wane. The wind
was less violent but much cooler. The sun had
dropped behind the mountains and the dusk was descending
upon the little Mexican town. A few of the
houses showed a light, but more of them were dark.
The Morgan house, a very long way down the street,
it seemed to the girl, was lit and she started to go
toward it. A sense of desolation, a forlornness greater
than she had ever known in all her short life descended
upon her. She swallowed quickly and increased her
pace. It wasn&#8217;t fear, she reflected, it was worse than
fear; it was the awful loneliness of one who had never
been really alone in her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first night at boarding-school multiplied by
a thousand,&#8221; she sobbed softly. &#8220;Oh, why did I come
to this awful place? I simply can&#8217;t stay all night with
that deaf woman and those mumpy children! I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She jumped back in time to avoid an automobile
which seemed to flash out of nothingness at her elbow.
As she stood looking after it a wild hope came into
her head that it might be Bob after all. The car
stopped and a man jumped out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it you, señorita?&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;alone and in
the dark?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Juan Pachuca. Polly sighed, disappointed to
tears. She tried to explain the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in two hours I will have you in Athens,&#8221; he
begged. &#8220;Or is it that you wish to stay with these
people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t wish to stay! The children
have the mumps and the poor old lady is nearly wild.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come. Give me that bag. So&mdash;I thought all
Americans were sensible people!&#8221; And before Polly
could object she found herself seated in the car with
Juan Pachuca driving silently at her side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>JUAN PACHUCA</h3>
</div>

<p>About half an hour after his conversation with Mrs.
Van Zandt, Marc Scott drove the buckboard with its
two lively horses out on the Conejo road. Beside him
sat a blond dog of mixed genealogy answering to the
name of &#8220;Yellow.&#8221; Scott had put on a coat over his
flannel shirt, tucked his trousers into a pair of riding
boots, and replaced his sombrero with a soft cloth hat.
These changes having been made in honor of the visitor,
he felt that his duty had been fulfilled and he addressed
Yellow ruminatively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I expect we got to brush up a bit on our
manners if we&#8217;re going to have a young lady around,
eh, Yellow? Going to be some strain on us both, I&#8217;ll
say. Funny idea to run off to a place like this just
because you&#8217;ve quarreled with your young man! Got
the temper that goes with red hair, I guess. I remember
a red-haired girl I used to know in Detroit&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; A
grin succeeded the worried look on Scott&#8217;s face; evidently
the adventure with the red-haired girl had had
its humorous side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, get up, Romeo, we&#8217;ve got to reach that girl
before Mendoza dumps her in the ditch and gets her
mussed up or the boss&#8217;ll fire us both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Romeo, a good-looking gray, with an excitable nature,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
snorted as he felt the touch of the whip and
dragged his gentler mate into a lively trot. A new
moon, clear cut and beautiful, was rising behind them,
over the tall mountains, making the valley&mdash;so bare by
day&mdash;lovely and mysterious in its half light.</p>
<p>&#8220;No kind of a night to be driving around with a
dog, Yellow,&#8221; remarked the driver, reproachfully.
&#8220;Men and moonlight are made for better things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The horses trotted briskly; they were covering
ground rapidly. They ought, Marc figured, to meet
the machine this side of Junipero Hill, a steep and cruel
grade which he would be glad to spare his horses if
he could. If Mendoza was making any sort of speed
he ought to have come that far. He began to watch
for the lights of the machine. The girl must be
plucky, even if she was foolish, to dare a trip like this
with a strange Mexican.</p>
<p>Well, he was glad Bob&#8217;s sister was nervy; he liked
nervy girls and he liked Bob. Usually fellows who
came out from college and took positions over other
men&#8217;s heads made fools of themselves; but Bob was
not a fool. He was a decent, likable young chap, who
knew he had been luckier than the next fellow and
who took no advantage of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is more than you can say of most rich
men&#8217;s sons,&#8221; soliloquized Scott. &#8220;But then why
should you expect sense from a rich man&#8217;s son?
Where&#8217;d they get it? It&#8217;s hard knocks gives a man
sense&mdash;if he&#8217;s ever going to get it, which most of them
ain&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was loneliness in the air. Scott, who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
temperamental, as out-of-doors men often are, felt it
keenly. It brought before him more clearly the loneliness
of his own life, a life spent in out-of-the-way
places, largely among men; a life with no roots, he
sometimes felt. Yet he would not have traded his
freedom, he would have told you, for any woman, for
a home or for children. To be foot loose, to go where
fancy called him, to have no ties&mdash;no clogs upon his
precious liberty, that was what he loved.</p>
<p>He was fond of women, too. He liked being with
them and he liked measuring each one he met with
his ideal, a hazy creature who probably did not exist.
Well, he rather hoped she didn&#8217;t, or if she did that
he would never meet her. He had known too many
men who had traded their freedom for a home and a
fireside and who, once bound, had never been able to
go back to the old life. It had not always been the
women who had held them, either; the men themselves
had seemed to change&mdash;to deteriorate, Scott
would have said&mdash;to have lost the energy and the vigor
that made life worth while. You cannot get anything
for nothing and you paid for the happiness you might
find in marriage with the loss of the one thing which
was to him the most important thing in all life&mdash;liberty.</p>
<p>So they jogged along, Scott whistling to keep himself
company. Occasionally, Yellow would insist upon
getting out for a run, but he seemed glad to return.
After a while it began to seem odd to Scott that he did
not see the lights of Mendoza&#8217;s car. Even a cautious
driver should have made the distance by this time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>Suddenly, an idea popped into his head&mdash;one of those
clammy ideas, which come instantly, and come with a
chill; ideas that are positively physical in the way in
which they affect one. Suppose it was Mendoza&#8217;s car
with someone else driving it? Someone of the score
of half-breeds who hung around the livery stable where
the car was kept? Scott leaned over and laid the whip
on the innocent Romeo.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, horse, we&#8217;ve got to go some the rest of
the way! If&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not finish the sentence. They had reached
the top of a hill and he put on the brake as they
started down. At the foot of the hill stood an automobile&mdash;not
Mendoza&#8217;s shabby little Ford&mdash;but a big
car with two large headlights. It was turned across
the road and not a soul was in sight. Scott took his
foot off the brake and with a muttered curse let the
buckboard rattle down the hill.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Polly&#8217;s first sensation, as she sank into the comfortable
seat next the driver and buried her face in the
collar of her coat, was one of intense relief. This was
something that seemed like home. She felt herself
being whirled up the streets of Conejo with the feeling
of one who is escaping, the flight being for the time
of more importance than the fashion in which one flies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will be cold,&#8221; said a polite voice at her
elbow. &#8220;Wait&mdash;I have a robe.&#8221; And a blanket which
smelled of the stable rather than of the garage was
wrapped carefully around her. &#8220;In a few moments
we shall be out of this sand.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>For a while they rode in silence, then the girl said,
apologetically:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sorry. I didn&#8217;t want you to go to all this
trouble&mdash;but I couldn&#8217;t stay in that awful place when
Bob is so near!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think Conejo is bad I wonder what you
would think of some of our towns further south?
They are ruins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years of revolution&mdash;they do not improve a
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly did not reply. She peeped out of her collar
and saw that Pachuca&#8217;s prophecy was fulfilled. They
had ridden out of the area of the sand-storm and were
getting into the foothills where the air was cold and
clear. They faced the new moon which gave an eerie
look to everything&mdash;the distant mountains, the foothills
with their weird patches of vegetation, tall cacti
and dark looking arroyos. Far, far in their rear could
be seen the few feeble lights of Conejo. It began to
dawn upon an awed Polly that she was doing not an
unconventional but a distinctly risky thing.</p>
<p>What did she know about this good-looking boy
who sat beside her, guiding the car so expertly through
the ruts and chuck holes that chopped up the road?
Suppose he turned out to be&mdash;she caught her breath
angrily! He was no common Mexican but a gentleman
and one was not afraid of men of one&#8217;s own
class, she told herself. She would not be afraid. She
hated people who were afraid. She was having a
wonderful experience; the sort of an experience that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
girls read about but didn&#8217;t have, and she was going to
enjoy it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to ask you if you had anything to eat,&#8221;
said Juan Pachuca. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had crackers,&#8221; said Polly. &#8220;What did you
have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was more fortunate. I found my friend at
dinner,&#8221; replied the young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you going when you met me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventually to my ranch, but first to find you. I
did not think you would stay with the Señora Morgan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly laughed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;Do you know, she
seemed to think it doubtful that Bob and Emma had
come back to Athens? I wonder why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied the Mexican, &#8220;she thought the
country not quite safe for a young lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought things were settling down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no settling down until after the
elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The elections?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not understand. Americans never do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps some of us might if you gave us a chance;
but when you go rearing and pitching around, killing us
and raiding border towns like that murderous
Villa&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In war there is no murder,&#8221; said Juan Pachuca,
calmly. &#8220;And Villa is a friend of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help it, and I think it&#8217;s very strange
for a well brought up boy like you to be friends with
a man like Villa.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>Pachuca laughed as he glanced at the girl&#8217;s wrathful
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you call me a well brought up boy?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are, aren&#8217;t you? You remind me a
lot of a cousin of mine who&#8217;s just entering college.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is the cousin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nineteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was nineteen I was a colonel in the army,&#8221;
said Juan Pachuca, whimsically. &#8220;That was six
years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in our country we don&#8217;t take boys of nineteen
very seriously,&#8221; said Polly, a little upset. &#8220;Did
you fight much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal. I suppose then that young men of
nineteen do not fall in love either in your country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they do, but nobody pays much attention
to them. We call it puppy love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Puppy love!&#8221; Juan frowned. &#8220;You are a
strange people&mdash;you Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose we are but we like ourselves that
way. Do you think that engine of yours is all right?
It sounds queer to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives me trouble sometimes. It needs what
you call an overhauling, but it will take us to
Athens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly, with an ear trained to engine sounds, wondered
whether it would. She felt that the last straw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
would be to be stranded in the middle of the night in
a lonely spot with this good-looking young man, who,
to make matters worse, had turned out to be twenty-five
instead of nineteen. Again they sat in silence
while the machine wrenched itself in and out of ruts
and through arroyos.</p>
<p>She found herself wondering what his life had been?
A colonel at nineteen! She remembered the boys she
had known in our own army, boys she had fed and
sewed for on their way to France. They, too, had
seemed young, but she felt a great difference. This
young man suggested things of which Polly knew little.
She wondered whether it was imagination that
made her fancy that he had played a part in life which
does not usually fall to twenty-five, except in a country
so disordered, so desperate as Mexico.</p>
<p>Some of her boy friends who had come back from
France and Belgium had carried in their faces some
such suggestion, but only a few. For the most part
they had come back as they went over, those who had
returned whole; husky, lively, youngish chaps&mdash;more
restless, less satisfied with life at home, perhaps, but
not older particularly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why he seems odd to me,&#8221; she concluded.
&#8220;He&#8217;s done and seen things that a fellow his age
hasn&#8217;t any business to have done and seen&mdash;that is, the
way we look at it at home. Oh dear, I wonder if we&#8217;re
ever going to get there? I can&#8217;t keep still much longer
and yet I hate to stir him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls in your country, do they fall in love at
nineteen?&#8221; said Juan Pachuca, suddenly. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
a softness in his voice that under other conditions&mdash;say,
in a ballroom&mdash;Polly would probably have described
as melting. In her present environment it
struck her less pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls? Oh, yes, of course they do; but not in the
desperate, hot-headed way your young ladies do. At
least, not usually. Of course some girls do queer
things and get into the newspapers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, our young ladies do not get into the newspapers,&#8221;
commented Juan Pachuca. &#8220;They are guarded
quite carefully; that is, our girls of good family. Most
of them are very beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t they just a little bit tiresome? I mean,
just being beautiful and guarded and all that sort of
thing. At home we like a girl who has seen a little of
life,&#8221; apologetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a young lady of family!&#8221; said Pachuca, decidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, in America we don&#8217;t think a lot
about family, though it&#8217;s nice to have it if you can.
We think more of education and getting on in the
world. Señor, I wish you would get down and look
at that engine; there&#8217;s something awfully wrong with
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly spoke suddenly for Juan Pachuca was leaning
very close to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your young ladies are charming,&#8221; he said, softly.
&#8220;I had always heard it and now I know it is true.&#8221;
His black eyes were dancing; it would have taken
some guessing to know whether with excitement or
laughter or both. &#8220;Do they ever forget themselves so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
far as to allow themselves a love affair on a silver
night when&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they do not,&#8221; said Polly, half severely and
half amused. It was difficult to take Juan Pachuca&#8217;s
rudeness seriously and yet&mdash;oh, why had she come?</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a desperate, hot-headed love affair such as
pleases the young ladies of my country,&#8221; he pursued,
seizing the hand so near him. &#8220;But one of those&mdash;what
do you call them in your tongue&mdash;flirtations?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was laughing but there was a smoldering fire
back of the laughter, and the grasp of his hand was
strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor, now please&mdash;remember that I didn&#8217;t come
with you because I wanted to, but because I had to!
Please!&#8221; For Pachuca&#8217;s arm had slid itself deftly
around her and was drawing her toward him, gently,
but with an exceeding firmness, while the dancing dark
eyes continued to laugh into hers. &#8220;There, see what
you&#8217;ve done!&#8221;</p>
<p>The big car had given a most unwieldy lurch,
wedged a tire in a rut, bounced a couple of times,
and stopped&mdash;providentially&mdash;on the edge of the deep
gully that fringed the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; declared the young man, a bit
stunned by the suddenness of the affair. The car,
however, refusing to back, gave him the lie. Polly
tore herself from his detaining arm and was out in the
road.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had an electric torch I could tell you what
it is,&#8221; she said, trying to control both nerves and temper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
for she was both frightened and angry. &#8220;Have
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; replied Pachuca, a little stiffly. &#8220;But,
please, dear lady, do not get down in the dirt! I beg
of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind. I know every little pain an engine
can have. I drove an emergency car at home during
the war,&#8221; said Polly, curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; Juan Pachuca&#8217;s voice was cool. The
young lady was business-like&mdash;too business-like to flirt
with&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that.&#8221; Polly shook the curls out of
her eyes and slammed the cover of the radiator.
&#8220;Where do you think it is? You ought to know something
about this car; you&#8217;ve been driving it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca&#8217;s eyes danced. What was the use of being
stiff with an American? They were all alike&mdash;the men
after money, and the women after what they called
independence!</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, demurely, &#8220;that it must be
attacked from underneath, if you will hold the
torch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; Polly smiled. &#8220;Go ahead. If you
can&#8217;t find it, I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it was that Marc Scott&#8217;s first acquaintance
with Polly Street came as he pulled the excited team
to its haunches within a few feet of the automobile,
and she, holding Juan Pachuca&#8217;s torch, jumped to her
feet and faced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, eagerly, &#8220;is that you, Bob?&#8221;
Then, seeing more clearly, &#8220;I beg your pardon!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
We&#8217;ve had trouble with the car, but we&#8217;ve fixed it and
we&#8217;ll be out of the way in a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not Bob Street, but I&#8217;m from Athens, and I&#8217;m
looking for Bob&#8217;s sister. I guess you must be her,&#8221;
replied Scott. &#8220;Well, who are you?&#8221; he added, as
Juan Pachuca&#8217;s legs emerged from the car, followed by
his body.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not Mendoza&mdash;he&#8217;s sick,&#8221; volunteered Polly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a gentleman who was in the train and who kindly
drove me over. Where is my brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your letter only came to-night,&#8221; stammered Scott,
&#8220;and in the same mail we had one from your brother
in Douglas, saying he had been called East&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;East!&#8221; The blow was too sudden; Polly&#8217;s legs
collapsed. She sat down on the running-board of the
machine and gasped. In the meantime Juan Pachuca
stepped to the buckboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Señor Scott?&#8221; he said pleasantly. &#8220;We have
met before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott surveyed him thoughtfully. &#8220;Well, by
the Lord, if it ain&#8217;t Johnny Pachuca! Of all the
nerve&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; grinned Pachuca, appreciatively. &#8220;You
are surprised, eh? What are you going to do about
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends upon how you&#8217;ve treated the young
lady,&#8221; said Marc, quietly, &#8220;and on your general behavior,&#8221;
he added, with a reciprocal grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I told you that he was kind enough to
drive me over?&#8221; said Polly, impatiently. &#8220;And
if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That being the case,&#8221; replied Scott, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
as there&#8217;s anything I can do except say much obliged,
and keep my eye on my horse-flesh. If you&#8217;ll get into
the wagon, Miss &mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Pachuca, airily, as the girl
hesitated. &#8220;He&#8217;s the manager of the Athens mine&mdash;Marc
Scott&mdash;a very decent fellow. I regret being deprived
of your company, señorita, but he evidently intends
to take you back with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any baggage?&#8221; demanded Scott, gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One trunk,&#8221; replied Polly, rather dazed by the suddenness
of the affair. &#8220;But it&#8217;s back at Conejo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want any help with that car?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, the young lady and I have remedied
the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there&#8217;s no use in my asking if there&#8217;s
any particular reason for your being in this neighborhood,
Pachuca?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is always a reason for my being where I
am,&#8221; was the suave reply. &#8220;This time it does not
concern you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. No revolutions up your sleeve,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca chuckled. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be too sure of that,
<i>amigo</i>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Would you take the advice of a
friend, Marc Scott?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might, if you&#8217;d guarantee he ain&#8217;t lying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell your people to close up their mine, take
their women and get out of the country. There is
trouble coming,&#8221; and the young Mexican bowed politely
to the girl and returned to his machine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what do you suppose the young devil meant
by that?&#8221; demanded Scott, as he turned the team and
faced the hill again. Polly&#8217;s eyes were wide open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; she said, eagerly. &#8220;You seemed to
know him. Does he really live near here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he has a ranch about here somewhere&mdash;some
ways south. As to where he lives I reckon he
could hardly tell you that himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where did you know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know him. I don&#8217;t want to know him.
The last time I saw him was when Villa stopped over
with us on one of his retreats. This guy was with
him. That little visit cost us a dozen good horses,
two hundred dollars, and our winter&#8217;s supply of canned
goods. He&#8217;s an expensive acquaintance, that fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s face was full of horror. &#8220;Do you mean,&#8221;
she gasped, &#8220;that I&#8217;ve been riding around the country
with a Mexican bandit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;d call him a bandit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me that he was a colonel in the army!&#8221;
indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he was, so I&#8217;ve heard. He&#8217;s been quite a
lot of things. Maybe we&#8217;d better not talk about him
any more to-night. It&#8217;s kind of exciting for you after
all you&#8217;ve been through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exciting!&#8221; Polly sank back in her seat limply.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was all right to you, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; continued
Scott, a little shyly. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t fresh or anything like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he was all right,&#8221; murmured the girl,
quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;These Mexicans are queer. You can&#8217;t tell what
they&#8217;ll do,&#8221; went on Scott. &#8220;Sometimes they&#8217;ve got
manners like the President of the United States, and
the next time they&#8217;ll do something that&#8217;d disgrace a
pirate. Take &#8217;em all around as they go, I guess Pachuca
stacks up pretty well. He&#8217;s educated and comes
of good folks. But how the deuce did you happen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose it does sound awful!&#8221; Polly said,
in a rush. &#8220;But he was on the train and when the
horrid little thing stopped on the side of a hill for two
hours, he came along and explained what was the
matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He talks English like a Bostonese,&#8221; said Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t he? And anything that sounds like Boston
just naturally puts confidence in a Chicagoan, don&#8217;t
you know? Then when I landed at Conejo in that
wild sand-storm with no one to meet me and the Morgans
out of town, he offered to drive me over, and I
let him. It didn&#8217;t seem far; why, at home we often
drive that far in an evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, driving around the boulevard with your
friends is one thing, and around this sort of country
with a strange Mexican is another.&#8221; Scott paused at the
sight of the girl&#8217;s penitent face, and changed the subject.
&#8220;As for your brother, we had a letter from him
to-night saying that he and the bride had gone East.
The directors sent for him, so they started pronto. I
reckon Miss Emma&#8217;s folks coaxed them to stay in
Douglas a few days after the wedding&mdash;we had expected
them here before this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott cleared his throat nervously. &#8220;Well, you see,
he wrote me to read all his mail&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he stopped,
abruptly. &#8220;Go on, Romeo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. You opened my letter and found out that I
was coming, and came to meet me. I am very much
obliged to you.&#8221; The words were pleasant enough
but the tone was cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s on the trail,&#8221; Scott thought, disconsolately.
&#8220;She&#8217;s running over in her mind what she said in
that letter, and when she remembers, it&#8217;s going to be a
good idea to get home as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this, the silence was extremely marked. Scott,
feeling the discomfort of it, continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad for you to have had this long trip and
then miss your brother after all, but I guess he&#8217;ll be
back soon, the way things are looking.&#8221;</p>
<p>More silence, but Scott was not going to be scared
out of his good intentions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we can make you pretty comfortable till
he comes. We&#8217;ve got a mighty pleasant lady running
the boarding-house just now and she&#8217;ll be glad enough
to have another white woman on the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silence still continuing, he gave up. &#8220;Hang it,
if she won&#8217;t talk, she won&#8217;t,&#8221; he thought. Then as he
turned to tuck in a flying end of robe he saw the girl&#8217;s
face. &#8220;Great guns, she&#8217;s asleep&mdash;poor kid!&#8221;</p>
<p>The end of a far from perfect day had come for
Polly Street, and even an uncomfortable seat with a
hard back and the joltings of a rough road had failed
to keep her awake. She was asleep, sitting up, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
head drooping, her body relaxed. In a few seconds
she would be leaning comfortably on the broad shoulder
next her. Without interrupting the team&#8217;s even
trot, Scott leaned down, fished another blanket from
under the seat and arranged it on the back of the seat
between them just in time to receive Polly&#8217;s sleepy
head, so that she rested half on the blanket, and half
on his own steady bulk for the rest of the trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor youngster, she has had a day of it,&#8221; the man
said softly, as he arranged the blanket carefully around
her. &#8220;And, by gum, I&#8217;ll bet she hasn&#8217;t had a mouthful
to eat since noon! Well, women have endurance,
I&#8217;ll say they have. Built like Angora kittens and with
the constitutions of beef critters. Go on, Romeo&mdash;I
don&#8217;t want her fainting with hunger on my hands,
she&#8217;s mad enough at me now.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>POLLY ARRIVES</h3>
</div>

<p>It was midnight when the buckboard stopped in
front of the company house where Mrs. Van Zandt and
Henry Hard assisted the drowsy Polly out of the
wagon, while Scott painstakingly performed the introductions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to eat since noon!&#8221; gasped Mrs. Van
Zandt, in horror. &#8220;What on earth was old lady Morgan
thinking of? Mr. Hard, if you&#8217;ll throw some
more wood into the stove, I&#8217;ll put on the percolator
and run down to the dining-room for some sandwiches.&#8221;
She ran off in one direction, while Scott
drove the team in another, leaving Hard to do the
honors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame to have things happen this way,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;A thousand times I&#8217;ve heard Bob talk about
having you come down here, and now that you&#8217;ve
come, he&#8217;s flying in another direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my own fault,&#8221; admitted Polly, honestly.
&#8220;We are all so sudden in our family&mdash;make up our
minds and hardly wait to write or telegraph. I might
have known that Bob would be doing something just
as queer as I was. How comfortably you have this
place fixed! Am I turning you out of it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re tramps, Scott and I. We thought it
would be pleasanter for you to be here with Mrs. Van
Zandt, so we moved ourselves out. We rather like
changing about.&#8221; He built up the fire and adjusted
the percolator, while Polly divested herself of her hat
and coat and sat down in a comfortable chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be for long,&#8221; she said, decidedly. &#8220;I
shall go back as soon as I can now that Bob and Emma
are home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t. Apart from the very great
pleasure that it gives us all to see someone from home,
it would be a pity to let you go back without seeing
some of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly laughed in spite of her weariness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me as though I&#8217;d seen the entire country
of Mexico to-day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Such a trip!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it, though? The first time I made it I said:
&#8216;Here is where I locate for life and found a colony.
I&#8217;ll never have the courage to go home.&#8217; But I got
over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt bustling in, followed by Scott, their
hands full of provisions, found the two chatting sociably.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have had cake for you,&#8221; volunteered the former,
&#8220;if Dolores and her beau hadn&#8217;t ate it all on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a midnight feast at boarding-school,&#8221;
chuckled the visitor, waked up by the coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the spreads we used to have when we was
on the road,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Zandt, meditatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the road?&#8221; Polly&#8217;s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Van was one of the original &#8216;Floradora Sextette,&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
remarked Scott, soberly. &#8220;The only one who
didn&#8217;t marry a millionaire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot you know about it,&#8221; retorted the lady. &#8220;I
was in the &#8216;Prince of Pilsen,&#8217;&#8221; she informed Polly,
confidentially. &#8220;I understudied the &#8216;Widow&#8217; on the
road. It was an interesting life,&#8221; she concluded,
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been,&#8221; replied Polly, politely. &#8220;How
did you happen to come West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Oh, I came West with an invalid,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Van, easily. &#8220;She was one of the cranky kind&mdash;middle-aged
and none of her family could live with
her. You&#8217;ve seen that kind? They wanted she should
have a trained nurse and the trained nurse never was
born that she could get along with. Trained nurses
are awful bossy&mdash;they can&#8217;t help it, they&#8217;re supposed to
be; that&#8217;s all the difference there is between them and
the ones that ain&#8217;t trained. So I come out to look
after her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she die?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not she. Get it out of your head that lungers always
die&mdash;they don&#8217;t. She got well and went home
and nagged the life out of her family for years. Last
I heard of her, she&#8217;d taken up with a young fellow she
met at a skating rink and her folks were wild for fear
she&#8217;d marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you stayed out West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and sometimes I&#8217;ve regretted it. New York&#8217;s
the place to live. I had a swell flat in a good neighborhood
and rented rooms to single gents and business
women&mdash;they&#8217;re the ones that have the money. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
interesting, too. I&#8217;d put an &#8216;ad&#8217; in the Sunday paper
and all day Monday folks would be coming to see my
rooms; I met some real nice people that way. Well, I
think you&#8217;d better be turning in; you&#8217;ll feel this to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott and Hard rose and said good-night.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a plucky girl, Scott,&#8221; said the latter, as they
walked down the silent road together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who brought her over from Conejo?&#8221;
demanded Scott, with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you said Mendoza did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mendoza&#8217;s sick and she took a dislike to old Mrs.
Morgan, so she came over with Juan Pachuca in his
car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re joking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not. I drove as far as Junipero Hill and
when I got to the top of it I saw a big car at the foot,
twisted about, almost in the ditch. I found Johnny
on his stomach under the car and the girl holding an
electric torch for him. She said she&#8217;d been underneath
giving him a hand with it. I wouldn&#8217;t put it past her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the child must be out of her head,&#8221; protested
Hard, weakly. &#8220;They don&#8217;t do those things&mdash;even in
these degenerate days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you and me are behind the times, Henry.
And then, you know Pachuca&#8217;s manners. Something
between the King of Spain and Chauncey Depew. Any
woman&#8217;d fall for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But nothing. Pachuca brought her over and he
behaved himself while he was doing it as near as I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
find out. What I want to know is what the smooth
young devil wants around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a revolution in the air, Pachuca would
throw in his lot with Obregon and De la Huerta.
What he thinks about the First Chief is unprintable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had the cheek to tell me to close up the mine
and get out of the country,&#8221; grinned Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;That may mean something and it may not.
They&#8217;re keen about their bit of melodrama, these chaps.
My El Paso paper says that there is a rumor again
about troops having been ordered in from Chihuahua.
That looks as though they were afraid of something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or else were trying to stir up something,&#8221; replied
the other. &#8220;Obregon&#8217;s never going to stand for Carranza&#8217;s
candidate for the election. His own chances
are too good. It might be a wise plan for the Government
to stir up a little revolution on its own hook and
get in the first hits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be. Anything might be down here; that&#8217;s
why it&#8217;s such an interesting place to live. Still, I don&#8217;t
altogether like the idea of Pachuca roaming the country
like a lion escaped from a circus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those lions never do much harm,&#8221; observed Scott,
cheerfully. &#8220;Of course, if he hitches up with
Villa&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to have heard that he and Villa had a row.
I should say he was more likely to try to organize a
crowd of his own and get in on the fireworks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he does it&#8217;s good-bye to our fellows,&#8221; said Scott.
&#8220;It would be a case of the Pied Piper and the rats;
and Johnny&#8217;s a mighty good piper.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>Hard glanced at his companion in some amusement.
Scott, who was a man of little education, had periodic
spells of promiscuous reading, and frequently surprised
his friend with his references.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be only our men, either,&#8221; he said, a
moment later.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of that,&#8221; replied Scott. &#8220;Old Herrick&#8217;s
would go, too. I wish you could persuade him
to go back to England, Hard; that ranch of his is no
place for an artist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard nodded. &#8220;I doubt if I could,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Herrick&#8217;s obstinate.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the cabin where they were to sleep
and were hailed drowsily but inquisitively by Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, you guys! Did you find the lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did, and she asked warmly after you,&#8221; replied
Scott. Then, in a low tone to Hard: &#8220;No use saying
anything about Pachuca to the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard nodded. &#8220;Better not,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she? I think you lie,&#8221; replied Adams, sleepily.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be any noisier than you can help, you two, getting
to bed. I&#8217;ve lost two hours of my beauty sleep
now waitin&#8217; up for you and I need my rest.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to my place to give the men their
breakfast,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Zandt, looking into Polly&#8217;s
bedroom the next morning. &#8220;Just you lay in bed until
you&#8217;re rested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m rested now,&#8221; said the girl, sitting up. &#8220;Is
there&mdash;no, of course there isn&#8217;t a bathtub on the
place?&#8221; she laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bathtub? Well, I should say not, but your pitcher&#8217;s
full, I guess. You&#8217;ll get used to being without
bathtubs after a while. They ain&#8217;t half as important
as folks think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind. I&#8217;ve camped,&#8221; said Polly, heroically.
&#8220;What I really wanted to ask you was how soon you
thought I could get away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away? Why, ain&#8217;t you just come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I thought Bob was here. I never would
have dumped myself down upon a lot of strangers like
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s all that bothers you, turn over and get
another nap. If the Superintendent&#8217;s own sister ain&#8217;t
got a right to a few weeks&#8217; board and lodging, I don&#8217;t
know who has. As for the boys, don&#8217;t worry about
them. I&#8217;m an honest-to-goodness widow and I guess
I can chaperon you all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly laughed again. Mrs. Van Zandt&#8217;s eye took in
her appearance thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you sleep in those things all the time?&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I mean, are they all you brought?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly glanced at her diaphanous pajamas and nodded
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll see that you have an extra blanket.
Nights are cold here,&#8221; and Mrs. Van hurried away.
Polly called after her. &#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, reappearing
in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Bob&#8217;s room, Mrs. Van Zandt?&#8221; the girl
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s Mr. Hard&#8217;s, but you needn&#8217;t worry about
him. He&#8217;ll be quite comfortable at the other house.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Polly blushed. One hates
to be curious, and yet&mdash;&#8220;I was wondering who that
was?&#8221; pointing to a photograph on the dresser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her name&#8217;s Conrad&mdash;she&#8217;s a widow woman from
Boston, an old friend of his. Pretty, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never told me anything about her,&#8221; admitted
Mrs. Van, candidly. &#8220;Mr. Hard ain&#8217;t one to chatter
about his private affairs, but I got it out of Marc
Scott.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said she was a singer; married an Englishman
and lived down near Mexico City. Husband died two
or three years ago. I&#8217;ve a notion she&#8217;s an old sweetheart
of Henry Hard&#8217;s&mdash;you can tell from her clothes
it&#8217;s an old picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like her looks,&#8221; commented Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I. Give me a wide-awake looking woman
every time,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Van Zandt. &#8220;There, I must
hustle or Dolores will put red pepper in the eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly stared at the photograph. It was of a tall,
slender woman, with large dark eyes, and obviously of
a personality distinctly pleasing. She had, even in the
photograph, an air of vitality which accounted for Mrs.
Van&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he looks like the sort of man who would stay
single for a woman,&#8221; she said, pensively. Then her
thoughts returned to her own position. Her eyes filled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why did I come? Why did I?&#8221; she asked
herself for the fiftieth time. &#8220;Because I was a coward
and didn&#8217;t want to hear what people were going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
say about me. As though it mattered what the kind of
people I know think of anybody! And now I&#8217;ve marooned
myself in this dreadful place and I&#8217;ll have to
stay till Bob comes&mdash;we can&#8217;t go chasing each other
across the country like this. And that miserable Scott
man knows why I came! Well, I can snub him, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly planted both feet firmly on the floor and
reached for her stockings. A few minutes later she
stood in the doorway, a dark sweater drawn over her
lacy waist, her plaid skirt blowing in the breeze, and
her vivid hair covered only with a net. The air was
cool and bracing, the sun just beginning to be a bit
warm, the mountains emerging from behind fleecy
clouds, and the sky as blue as that of Italy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad, eh?&#8221; Hard stopped beside her, thinking
how her splendid youth and vibrant coloring harmonized
with the surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad at all,&#8221; laughed the girl. &#8220;You only need
a few wild looking Mexicans prowling about to give a
touch of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard pointed toward the mine. Some dark-skinned
men wearing big straw sombreros were running a hand
car up the track while another group lounged in a
doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are your Mexicans, but I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;re
too lazy to be very wild. Nothing but a revolution excites
them these days and sometimes I think they&#8217;re
getting a bit blasé over them. Now and then they
wake up over a cock-fight.&#8221; They walked down the
street toward the boarding-house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wish, Mr. Hard, that you would tell me something
about the young man who drove me over last
night,&#8221; the girl said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Scotty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; a little indignantly. &#8220;I mean Señor Pachuca.
Oh, I forgot that I hadn&#8217;t told you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott told me. He and I thought, if you don&#8217;t
mind, that we wouldn&#8217;t say anything about it before
the others. I mean about his being in the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t if you don&#8217;t want me to,&#8221; replied Polly,
with unusual docility. &#8220;But please tell me about him.
Mr. Scott didn&#8217;t seem to want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no, Scotty didn&#8217;t want to frighten you, I
suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frighten me? As if I was that kind of girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a little difficult these days to know what
one may or may not tell a young lady,&#8221; smiled Hard.
&#8220;But about Johnny Pachuca. A good many people
call him &#8216;Don Juan&#8217;&mdash;I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s because
he claims to be of pure Spanish blood, or whether
it&#8217;s a subtle recognition of his popularity with the
ladies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years ago, he was a captain or a colonel or
something equally fancy in the army. He&#8217;s a dashing
young scamp, and he had the good luck or the bad luck
whatever you want to call it to engage the affections
of a good-looking young actress who was supposed to
be bestowing those affections on a man higher up.
Naturally, the man higher up looked about for a way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
of getting even. He dug up a scandal about some
army funds. Young Pachuca had been doing what
seems to have been the usual thing down in Mexico
City&mdash;padding his accounts&mdash;so they got him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that they couldn&#8217;t have got anybody on the
staff on the same charge; but they were after Juan.
Juan had to choose between retiring to private life or
turning bandit. Having a taste for action, he did the
latter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean like Villa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no, Villa&#8217;s in a class by himself. You can&#8217;t
call a man who has controlled a state and who has
dictated to presidents, a bandit, can you? He&#8217;s on too
big a scale. Pachuca took up banditry, in a gentlemanly
sort of way; at least they say he did; nobody&#8217;s
proved it on him. He was undoubtedly with Villa at
one time. He was with him when he stopped here and
nabbed our horses. I was away at the time. I&#8217;ve
never seen the fellow. Then, gossip says, they quarreled
and Pachuca went back to his people in the
South. I haven&#8217;t a doubt, however, that if another
revolution should break out, Johnny would climb into
the band-wagon against the government and land in
the army again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the man I undertook to drive alone in
the dark with!&#8221; gasped the girl. &#8220;Mr. Hard, promise
me you&#8217;ll never tell Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; replied Hard, laughing. &#8220;And here
we are at breakfast. Miss Street, this is Mr. Williams,
who runs our store, Mr. Adams, of the office
force&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and so on until each had very consciously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
greeted the newcomer. Scott, who sat at the end of
the table, looked up and bowed, receiving a cool little
response. He returned unconcerned to his ham and
eggs. If the new arrival was going to be disagreeable,
he would keep out of her way.</p>
<p>Breakfast went off pleasantly. The food was excellent
and with the exception of Scott, who kept his distance,
everyone was quite evidently trying to put the
girl at her ease. From the train crew, who announced
their intention of running over to Conejo for her trunk,
to Adams who spoke for the privilege of taking her
over the plant, and Williams, who begged for an early
opportunity to show his collection of baskets and pottery,
each had something to offer. Even the black-eyed
Dolores peeped admiringly through the hole in the
wall, gathering items about the visitor to retail to the
eager ears of relatives and friends at the next <i>baile</i>.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Adams piloted Polly over the
premises, from the corral to the office. He showed her
the automobile lying idle because an important part
was broken and the new one though ordered from the
factory had not come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you ride?&#8221; he said, and as she nodded:
&#8220;that&#8217;s good. Maybe we can get up a party to ride
across the mesa to Casa Grande. That&#8217;s Herrick&#8217;s
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Herrick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Queer chap&mdash;part German and part English.
Artistic, you know&mdash;plays the piano and sings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing here if he&#8217;s an artist?&#8221; demanded
Polly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Runs a ranch and writes music. His wife died
suddenly&mdash;she used to travel around with him and sing
his songs&mdash;they made a pile of money, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean Victor Herrick!&#8221; gasped the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s him. He went to pieces when she died
and packed up his piano and his music and came down
here and buried himself on the ranch. Queer customer,
but you&#8217;ll like him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think that Bob Street never wrote me that
Victor Herrick was a neighbor of his&mdash;and then wrote
pages of stuff about those old Morgans!&#8221; said Polly,
indignantly. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve heard the Herricks sing&mdash;they
were wonderful! Men haven&#8217;t any sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, he likes the Morgans. She&#8217;s a jolly kind
of woman, invites a fellow to dinner and feeds him
up, you know,&#8221; said Jimmy, seriously. &#8220;They&#8217;re real
folks, the Morgans are, and Herrick&#8217;s a sort of a nut,
don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; He threw open the door of the office
abruptly. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the office, where the manager
sits with his feet on the desk while the rest of us
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott, who was standing by the window, turned suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Jimmy,&#8221; he said, with a grin. &#8220;Do you
know whether Johnson&#8217;s gone yet? Well, go over and
tell him to drop in at Mrs. Morgan&#8217;s and tell her that
the young lady got here safely; I can&#8217;t get Conejo on
the wire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Mr. Adams, please do!&#8221; said the girl,
eagerly. &#8220;She meant to be awfully kind but she was
worried to death about those children. I was too tired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
to have any patience and I felt as if I just had to get
away from Conejo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the first person who&#8217;s been struck that
way,&#8221; grinned Adams, as he left the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard tells me he has been talking to you about
Juan Pachuca,&#8221; said Scott, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you wouldn&#8217;t, so I had to ask somebody
else,&#8221; replied Polly. &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I noticed. Can&#8217;t you pick out something a little
more like home-folks to be interested in? Remember
the fellow who tried to bring up the tiger
cub?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to him?&#8221; Polly smiled up into
Scott&#8217;s face. There was something about Scotty that
appealed to you even when you were actively engaged
in disliking him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It grew up and bit him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, and Juan Pachuca seemed so nice and friendly.
But I suppose a tiger cub feels soft and furry when
it isn&#8217;t scratching or biting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. You can&#8217;t tell about these fellows down
here. Maybe Pachuca would have brought you over
here safe and sound, and maybe he would have taken
the south fork of the road down yonder and carried
you off to his ranch to hold for a ransom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Polly, faintly, &#8220;what a dreadful country!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s no place for tenderfeet. That&#8217;s what
I&#8217;m always telling our neighbor&mdash;Herrick, over at Casa
Grande. Bob ever write you about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob never writes me about anything&mdash;except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Emma,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;But Mr. Adams has been telling
me about him. Does he live there all alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s got a Chinese boy to cook for him and a
lot of greasers working on the place, but no white men
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could meet him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can. I&#8217;ll drive you over there any time you
say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s face hardened. &#8220;I won&#8217;t bother you,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;ll stay here. I want
to telegraph Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Johnson to wire him from Conejo,&#8221; said
Scott, a bit coolly on his side. &#8220;He may bring the
return message back with him to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly felt suddenly ashamed of herself. She rose
and held out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was awfully thoughtful of you, Mr. Scott,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m ever and ever so much obliged to you,
both for that and for last night. I suppose if it hadn&#8217;t
been for you Señor Pachuca might have been sending
pieces of my fingers to Bob for a ransom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott laughed but he took the hand awkwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Pachuca would do anything quite as
raw as that&mdash;especially with a lady,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m glad I went just the same. I don&#8217;t take chances
with these chaps. Shall we walk down to dinner?
Mrs. Van gets pretty peeved if we&#8217;re late to meals.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>LOCAL ACTIVITIES</h3>
</div>

<p>Johnson did not bring a return message from Chicago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Family ain&#8217;t got its breath yet, I reckon,&#8221; he said,
as he and Scott discussed the matter. &#8220;She looks to
me like the sort of youngster who could keep a family
pretty well stirred up,&#8221; he added, candidly. &#8220;Girls
have changed sence you and me was young, Scotty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said it,&#8221; was the terse reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can believe what these magazine fellers
write,&#8221; went on the engineer, pensively, &#8220;the girl of to-day
is a sort of mixture of bronc, ostrich, and rattlesnake
thrown in. Smokes, drinks&mdash;say, Scotty, I wonder
do they chew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me,&#8221; responded Scott. &#8220;I don&#8217;t go into
society much these days. I reckon, though, you&#8217;ve got
to take these writing chaps with a grain of salt.
There&#8217;s probably a few plain, ordinary girls left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of plain ones, if the newspapers
ain&#8217;t lyin&#8217;,&#8221; said Johnson, opening his home paper at
the society page and revealing three emaciated damsels,
clad in extremely short skirts, and with huge bird
cages over their ears. &#8220;Not that Miss Polly&#8217;s like
them,&#8221; he added, generously. &#8220;She&#8217;s a looker and a
lady, too. I like her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s lucky, Tom,&#8221; remarked Scott. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
her she can stay on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly did stay on. The next day a telegram came
from the happy bridegroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake stay where you are. Stop racing
around the country. Returning shortly. Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, the days passed like hours. Polly
rode with Scott, walked with Adams, chatted with
Hard, and helped Mrs. Van Zandt with the housework
when the latter would let her, which wasn&#8217;t often.
Now and then she remembered Joyce Henderson, and
when she did, her manner would cool toward Scott;
but one couldn&#8217;t go on holding a grudge long in that
climate. The glorious sun, coming after months of
dark chilly weather, seemed to melt anything in one&#8217;s
heart that was unfriendly. Joyce Henderson soon
faded into half-tones.</p>
<p>There were a dozen interesting things to do everyday.
A Mexican saddle with its high pommel and
cantle, was fascinating after an English one. Foothills
and arroyos were a charming part of one&#8217;s walk
after the boulevards and parks of Chicago. She
hugely enjoyed chatting in sign language with the
Mexicans and Indians on the place, and before a week
had passed she had picked up a number of Spanish
phrases which she used with delighted inaccuracy.</p>
<p>She believed that of the men she liked Hard the best.
He was the type of man she had always admired; the
best type of an American gentleman, a man of good old
family traditions, quiet and unassuming and yet full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
a pleasant humor. She wondered what had brought
him to Mexico&mdash;an unhappy love affair with the lady
who sang? But Hard was not a man of whom one
asked personal questions so she did not find out.</p>
<p>Scott, however, was the man who really interested
Polly Street though she did not realize it. Much of
that interest was due to the fact that he apparently did
not care whether he interested her or not. One moment
they would be on excellent terms, and the next
he would have forgotten her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That young man,&#8221; said Polly, sagely, &#8220;understands
the art of making himself popular. He knows
it irritates a woman to see a man absolutely indifferent
to her. It&#8217;s more than flesh and blood can stand. So
he acts that way, for it&#8217;s a pose, of course. Just for
that I&#8217;m going to make him like me&mdash;if I can spare
the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this she wronged Marc Scott, who was quite
innocent of the art of posing, and whose mind was on
other things these days than young women.</p>
<p>One day, about a fortnight after Polly&#8217;s arrival, she
and Scott rode over to a little village hidden in the
mountains some ten miles away. It was a warm day
and they were long on the road. It was nearing sundown
when they came within sight of Athens. Polly,
as usual, was talking:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re such queer people&mdash;Mexicans. They
can&#8217;t run their own country and they don&#8217;t want anybody
else to come in and run it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call that queer,&#8221; replied Scott.
&#8220;Chances are that if they let someone else in, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
wouldn&#8217;t be enough country left for them to put in their
eye, and they darn well know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not necessarily,&#8221; replied the girl, sturdily. &#8220;We
didn&#8217;t gobble up Cuba. We just helped them to get
on their feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cuba&#8217;s a different proposition. Cuba was being
coerced by an European power and, of course, we had
to stop it. Mexico is in the hands of her own people
and if you give them time they may make something of
her. Then, there&#8217;s the oil question. That&#8217;s sort of
soured the native population on us. You&#8217;d never persuade
a live Mexican that the U. S. came over here for
anything in the world but to grab the oil lands&mdash;whether
the U. S. was innocent or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not, and a good many of us wouldn&#8217;t be
innocent, would we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid not. You see, the oil business has developed
to an importance far beyond everything else
down here. When this man, Carranza, went into
office, he went in under what they call the Constitution
of 1917. It provides that the State is entitled to
retain what they call &#8216;subsoil rights.&#8217; That is, they
don&#8217;t want to sell oil lands or mines outright, they
just lease them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if they should decide, and a lot of them want
to, that that Constitution is retroactive&mdash;and undermines
the titles of land that&#8217;s already owned by foreign
capital, there&#8217;d be a lot of influence brought to bear to
make trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would affect our mine, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but mines are pretty small potatoes compared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
to oil. People down here will tell you that the Constitution
is merely a matter of form and that if the oil
men will go on paying their taxes nothing will happen;
but, of course, that sort of assurance doesn&#8217;t go far
when a man&#8217;s putting up his money. If they get a new
government down here, and we get a new one at home,
the chances are that the United States will demand
guarantees of some kind. It&#8217;s a bad question, take it
any way you like.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mexican says: &#8216;These oil lands are mine.&#8217;
And they are. The American says: &#8216;What good were
they to anybody when you had them?&#8217; None whatever,
and the world needs oil, so there you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode on for a few minutes in silence. Scott
watched, with the mixed pleasure of the horseman and
the admiring male, the girl&#8217;s graceful figure adapt itself
to the jog of the horse. He reflected that there
was something very clean-cut and alive about her,
from the way her hair sprang in its tight little waves
away from her firm white neck, to the quick flash of
her dark eyes; there was a vividness and a health
about her which appealed strongly to the out-of-doors
man.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been further from his idea of
a rich man&#8217;s daughter; a pampered being, all nerves
and affectations, helpless and parasitic. Of course she
was spoiled&mdash;used to being waited upon a good deal,
and with rather a good opinion of herself. One could
see that. On the other hand, it did not seem to go
very deep; seemed, rather, the sort of thing that might
rub off when it came in contact with life. Even the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
rich sometimes came into contact with life, he reflected,
with a feeling of satisfaction. They dodged
a good many rough knocks that the poor couldn&#8217;t
dodge, but something usually came along to even up
the score, if nothing else&mdash;the old boy with the scythe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Scott, when are you going to take me over to
see Casa Grande?&#8221; said the object of his meditations,
suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; Scott turned on her in well simulated surprise.
&#8220;Thought you didn&#8217;t want to go last time we
talked about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Polly blushed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve changed my mind. I
want to meet the celebrity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Victor Herrick? I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll care
much for him if you go over there looking for a celebrity.
He&#8217;s not that kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not the kind that likes to go to pink teas and
have a lot of women hanging around him,&#8221; explained
Scott, promptly. &#8220;Not a society woman&#8217;s pet. Too
good a musician, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like society people very much, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; candidly. &#8220;And I guess they wouldn&#8217;t
care much for me, so that squares it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the sort of people you mean by &#8216;society&#8217;
wouldn&#8217;t care for you,&#8221; said the girl, frankly. &#8220;But
there are people, you know, even among the rich who
have sense enough to know a worth-while man when
they meet him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Scott&#8217;s turn to show confusion. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mean that there aren&#8217;t any decent rich folks. I&#8217;m not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
such a blamed idiot as that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You, yourself,
have a lot more sense than an heiress has any
right to,&#8221; he added, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? I&#8217;m not an heiress. Father has a big salary,
of course, but we spend every cent of it. We don&#8217;t
mean to but we always do. Somehow, our expenses
crawl up every time the salary crawls. Of course,
there&#8217;s insurance, but that would go to Mother. You
see, they&#8217;ve educated both Bob and me well enough so
that we can support ourselves; I could be athletic instructor
in a girls&#8217; college to-morrow if I wanted to;
and Father&#8217;s invested a good deal in this mine on
Bob&#8217;s account. He thinks he&#8217;s done his duty by us
and I do, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Scott, soberly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in
these handed-down fortunes&mdash;money tied up for generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Polly, shyly, &#8220;that you&#8217;re a bit of a
socialist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I&mdash;only I&#8217;ve never found exactly the brand
of socialism that I believe in. Maybe they haven&#8217;t
discovered it yet. But I do believe that we&#8217;ve got to
do better by each other than we&#8217;re doing now if we&#8217;re
ever going to make a success of living. Whether it&#8217;s
got to come by individual reform or by some new
system of government, I don&#8217;t know, but things have
got to improve, and, by gum, I believe they will!
We&#8217;re too good, all of us, to be wasted the way most
of us are.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with a fire that Polly had never seen in
him before. She had thought him phlegmatic, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
here was something temperamental&mdash;something that
kindled enthusiasm in her. She was too hampered by
her own inexperience of life to know what to say to
him; she felt helpless in the presence of feelings that
she had never had and could not feel sure that she understood;
and she feared to say the wrong thing&mdash;she,
Polly Street, who had always said what she liked to
men and let them take it as they chose! It was a
queer feeling and she wondered&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, what&#8217;s that?&#8221; Scott stopped his horse
suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s what?&#8221; demanded the girl, startled. Then
as he did not answer, but continued to stare in the
direction of Athens, she cried impatiently: &#8220;What
are you looking at? Tell me now&mdash;this minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott took a pair of field-glasses from a case on his
saddle. He handed them to the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that look to you like Juan Pachuca&#8217;s car down
by the store?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly looked. &#8220;It does, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s too far to be sure. Who do you suppose
those men are on horseback?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Scott, shortly, as he took the
glasses and looked again. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t like the looks
of it. Let&#8217;s whip up and get to that arroyo that runs
back of the camp. We&#8217;ll ride the rest of the way in
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They descended into the arroyo which was a deep
one with sheltering sides that rose above them fully ten
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t go all the way,&#8221; objected the girl, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
was beginning to know the geography of the place already.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it to,&#8221; replied Scott. &#8220;It turns off
and runs at an angle&mdash;just above the dining-room.
I&#8217;m going to leave you and the horses there out of
sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t think I was going to turn tail and run
when the boys were being held up, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s eyes shone with a mixture of fear and excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it&#8217;s a real hold-up?&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t the least idea, but it sure does look like
one, especially if that&#8217;s Pachuca, himself, on that
sorrel. Then, again, it may be the Federal Government
quartering men on us. In either case ladies and
horse-flesh are better out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not afraid,&#8221; cried the girl, her teeth chattering
with excitement. &#8220;At least, I don&#8217;t think I am&mdash;much.
Anyhow, I&#8217;ll be lots more scared down here
in this hole alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be alone; you&#8217;ve got two good horses
to take care of. Thank the Lord, Hard is out of it&mdash;that&#8217;s
three horses we can save.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard had ridden to Conejo the day before and had
not returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave you this.&#8221; Scott took his revolver
from the holster and handed it to the girl, who
took it reluctantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more afraid of it than I am of Juan Pachuca,&#8221;
she pleaded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no call to be,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
a baby&mdash;brace up and stay here with these horses.
They&#8217;re not looking for you and they&#8217;ll never come
down here. These are the two best horses we&#8217;ve got
and I&#8217;m cussed if I&#8217;m going to hand &#8217;em over to a
bunch of greasers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Polly gasped again. No one had ever
spoken to her quite like this before. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go
unarmed, can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind me. You stay here till I come for
you. If anybody bothers you, you shoot. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott proceeded to climb cautiously out of the arroyo
and in a moment was out of Polly&#8217;s sight. He looked
back once and saw the girl standing where he had left
her, holding the reins of the two horses, her eyes
big with excitement, watching his every movement.
He waved his hand, then turned his back upon
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good youngster,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;Plenty of spunk but knows when to mind. I&#8217;m
afraid that if I was ten years younger I might make a
fool of myself&mdash;for she&#8217;d never look at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spot at which he had left the sheltering arroyo
was two or three hundred feet from the cabin in which
he was living with Hard and Adams. His idea was
to steal into the house from the rear, arm himself, and
then see what he could do, though, of course, he realized
that their small force could do little against Pachuca,
who not only had some twenty-five or thirty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
men of his own, but who could easily count on the
Mexicans who worked on the place.</p>
<p>As he walked quickly in the direction of the house,
he noticed Pachuca, for he it was on the sorrel horse,
giving orders loudly in Spanish to his men who were
scattered around the place&mdash;many of them down at the
corral. He did not see any of his own people, which
puzzled him a little. As he entered his cabin and
crossed the living-room to go to the bedroom, where
he kept an extra gun, he nearly stumbled over the
body of a man.</p>
<p>It was Adams, lying in the middle of the room, dead&mdash;or
had the boy only fainted? Scott rummaged in
the cupboard for the whiskey bottle and poured a bit
of the liquor down his throat. Jimmy opened his eyes
and stared dizzily around. Scott saw that the floor
around him was covered with blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, boy? Those hounds shoot you?&#8221; he
demanded. Adams grinned shakily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it, brainy one,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Help me
into a chair, Scotty, I ain&#8217;t dead, only winged in the
left hin&#8217; leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott lifted him gently and placed him in the chair,
then went into his room and secured the gun. He
brought a towel back with him and staunched the flow
of blood from the leg with a clumsily fashioned bandage.</p>
<p>&#8220;He busted in on us while we were taking our afternoon
naps,&#8221; said Jimmy, weakly. &#8220;I happened to be
taking mine in the office as per usual. I saw Pachuca
riding up so I grabbed my gun and beat it for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
door. They had me covered, about ten of them before
I could show my face. They asked for the cash box
and when I said we hadn&#8217;t one, one of &#8217;em blazed away
and hit me in the leg. When I toppled over they made
a rush for the office&mdash;most of &#8217;em over me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of that and it occurred to me that I&#8217;d
better clear out before it struck them that I might
know the combination. So while they were enjoying
themselves inside, I crawled down here. I hadn&#8217;t gone
half-way before I heard &#8217;em blow it up. Oh, yes, they
got the pay chest all right, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what then?&#8221; grunted Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the crowd had gone down to the corral
and the rest were down at the store. Just as I crawled
in here, I saw Williams come out of the store and get
it in the gun arm&mdash;the train gang were caught without
their guns, and they&#8217;ve got &#8217;em all lined up outside the
store. They&#8217;ve looted the store and the corral and
they&#8217;ve got all our greasers stirred up to join &#8217;em.
Say, there&#8217;s no use your mixing in&mdash;you can&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can spoil Don Juan&#8217;s pretty looks, I guess!&#8221;
snarled Scott. &#8220;That&#8217;ll be something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on&mdash;give me some more of that whiskey before
you go. Thanks. Now go and get your fool
head shot off if you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a growl of rage, Scott flung out of the house.
He strode in the direction of the store where the prisoners
still stood helplessly. They had seen firearms,
dry-goods, canned food, and Williams&#8217; cash box carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
out and deposited in the automobile which stood
at the side of the store. Now they awaited the next
move. Pachuca was evidently gathering his forces for
departure. The Athens Mexicans had collected their
families, their household goods, and whatever else they
could lay their hands on and were ready to follow.</p>
<p>These preparations for a general exodus were the
first things to strike Scott as he came out of the cabin.
It was exasperating, but what could you expect?
There was no knowing what rosy tale Pachuca had
told them; more than likely that the American army
had crossed the border and that they were striking for
their altars and their fires. He saw women, babies,
and household goods loaded upon his good horse-flesh
and disappearing down the road.</p>
<p>Scott&#8217;s blood boiled. His impulse was to shoot Juan
Pachuca without warning. He raised his arm and
then he paused. One does not shoot men in the back
easily unless one is used to doing it. At that moment
a Mexican saw him and yelled. Instantly everyone
saw him. Pachuca whirled his horse about. It reared
and plunged. Its rider laughed loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, there you are, friend Scott!&#8221; he called. &#8220;I
told you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He brought his gun from his hip with
a sudden twist. The two men fired simultaneously.
Scott thought&mdash;hoped&mdash;that he saw Pachuca waver,
but the air was full of smoke and he was dazed. He
fired again.</p>
<p>Pachuca&#8217;s horse began to pitch violently; it took all
its rider&#8217;s famous horsemanship to keep in the saddle.
At the same moment, two men stole up behind Scott,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
who was rushing forward, seized him, threw him to
the ground, and disarmed him. One of them took his
rope and bound the American, while both of them
grinned and muttered in Spanish.</p>
<p>By this time, Pachuca had defeated the evident intentions
of the sorrel to buck himself through the
store window, and uttering a cry dashed off in the
direction of the automobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adios, Señor Scott!&#8221; he cried, as he went.
&#8220;Next time you will take a neighbor&#8217;s good word, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time I&#8217;ll take a soft-nosed bullet and get you
back of the ear, you rotten little half-breed!&#8221; yelled
Scott, maddened with helplessness and rage, rolling in
the dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marc Scott, ain&#8217;t you got any sense? Keep your
mouth shut!&#8221; screamed Mrs. Van Zandt in terror as
they gathered around the prostrate man and untied him
while the last of the raiders rode off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they get everything?&#8221; he demanded as he got
to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;All except honor and they didn&#8217;t leave enough of
that to stick in your eye,&#8221; responded Mrs. Van, bitterly.
&#8220;They got Adams in the leg and Williams in
the arm and took off the whole greaser population.
Here, wipe your face off with this handkerchief before
you rub all that sand in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott obeyed meekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the girl?&#8221; demanded Williams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down the arroyo with the horses,&#8221; replied Scott.
&#8220;We saw the outfit in time or Pachuca&#8217;d have had her,
too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He asked me where she was and I told him she&#8217;d
gone home,&#8221; said Mrs. Van. &#8220;I was awful scared
Dolores would give me away but I reckon she didn&#8217;t
hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stared malevolently at the vanishing auto.
Pachuca had turned the sorrel over to another man
and was driving the car himself. Suddenly, they saw
him stop and give an order. Several of the men dismounted
and were laying something along the track.
Then with a yell, they all bolted, the auto in the lead,
the horsemen following. A few seconds and they had
disappeared around a curve in the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what the &mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Williams, when
he was answered&mdash;there was a crash, the sight of
rocks and sand flying, and a thunderous reverberation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mutts have blown up the track!&#8221; burst from
the engineer, furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would,&#8221; replied Scott, sourly. &#8220;Want to
cut us off from Conejo till they&#8217;ve made their getaway!
Probably cut the wires, too. Go and see, Miller. If
they haven&#8217;t, get Morgan and tell him Pachuca&#8217;s on the
rampage. Did he say what was up? What he was
doing this for?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not him,&#8221; said O&#8217;Grady, disgustedly. &#8220;Bring out
your dead&mdash;that&#8217;s Johnny Pachuca&mdash;no flourishes
about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You come in here with me and look at Joe Williams&#8217;
arm,&#8221; commanded Mrs. Van. &#8220;It don&#8217;t look to
me as if it was broke, do you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to Adams,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;Johnson, you go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
down to the arroyo and get the girl.&#8221; And he went
down the street to the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did he get everything?&#8221; demanded Adams,
as Scott entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;All he could carry. He left the victrola for you,
Jimmy, and the stove for Mrs. Van.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! What did you do with Miss Polly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Left her with the horses in the arroyo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was smart of you, Scotty. I&#8217;ll bet she wanted
to come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet she did, but she didn&#8217;t get to come. Let&#8217;s
have another look at the leg, Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>They bathed it as well as they could. It had stopped
bleeding and they bandaged it carefully with another
towel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the bone&#8217;s broke, Jimmy, but I don&#8217;t
like the looks of it,&#8221; said the amateur surgeon. &#8220;You
need a doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t any except that greaser over at
Conejo,&#8221; said Adams, gloomily. &#8220;Morgan says he&#8217;s
so dirty he won&#8217;t let him touch his kids. I don&#8217;t want
blood poisoning, you bet. Did they blow up the
track?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott nodded. &#8220;There&#8217;s Johnson,&#8221; he exclaimed,
looking out of the window. &#8220;He&#8217;s got the horses but
not the girl. Hey, there, Tom, where&#8217;s Miss Polly?&#8221;
he cried as the engineer dismounted and came into the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t there, Scotty. I found the horses tied
to a branch of a tree that grew out of the side of the
arroyo but there wasn&#8217;t no sign of the girl anywhere.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>Scott&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;She was scared and went
further up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Did you look?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looked and hollered and then some, but she was
clean gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott muttered something, flung out of the house and
threw himself on his horse. In a moment he was tearing
up the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that ugly devil going?&#8221; said Johnson, disgustedly.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell him she&#8217;d gone? Is he going
to try to chase Johnny Pachuca into the mountains
after her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone clean nuts!&#8221; remarked Adams, gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that when I seen him rolling in the dirt
and yelling &#8216;half-breed,&#8217;&#8221; replied Johnson. &#8220;You
might as well poison a Mexican as to call him &#8216;half-breed.&#8217;
According to them they&#8217;re all second cousins
to the King of Spain. Does your leg hurt much,
Jimmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had legs that felt better,&#8221; said Adams,
cheerfully. &#8220;Where you going, Tom?&#8221; as the long,
lank engineer swung out of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;To see the boss get his throat cut,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;Pachuca&#8217;s got the money, the guns and the girl; it
don&#8217;t seem very good sense to hand him the whole office
force but if the boss says so, here goes.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MISS CHICAGO</h3>
</div>

<p>Polly stood where Scott left her, gazing after him
with a mixture of horror and excitement; horror at the
thought that one of the terrible raids of which she had
so often heard was taking place scarce two hundred
yards from where she stood, and excitement because
she was there&mdash;she, Polly Street, who had so far in
her life never met with any adventure more thrilling
than a punctured tire or a lost golf match.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, it dawned upon her that Scott had
left her his only weapon; had gone empty-handed into
the trouble! The thought carried a double meaning.
He had told her that she was safe, but he had left her
his gun. Then there was danger&mdash;the Mexicans might
come and find her; secondly, he had gone unarmed for
her sake. He, the indifferent, the uncaring, the man
who didn&#8217;t mind whether she smiled on him or snubbed
him! Was it only because she was a girl and he a
man, or did he, after all, care a little bit?</p>
<p>She had threatened, boastingly, to make him care,
but she realized that she was beginning to care a little
herself; that she could not stay quietly in the arroyo
without knowing what was happening to him; that she
must see and hear no matter what the risk.</p>
<p>She looked about her in some perplexity. She had
been told that a western horse would stand contentedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
if his reins were thrown over his head; but she doubted
the universal truth of this statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;They might if there was grass for them to nibble,&#8221;
she decided. &#8220;But they never would in this hole.
Come on, ponies, let&#8217;s see what we can do.&#8221; And
gathering up the reins she led the horses in the direction
Scott had gone. She saw the place where he had
scrambled out of the arroyo, and, oh, good luck, a
clump of mesquite growing out of the crumbling wall
further down. She fastened the bridle reins to the
mesquite and left the horses contentedly chewing at it.</p>
<p>Very cautiously she crept up the incline and took a
peek at the situation. She was just in time to see
Scott disappear into the cabin where Adams lay
wounded. Polly&#8217;s face fell. That didn&#8217;t look very
heroic&mdash;crawling in by the back door! No wonder he
didn&#8217;t want her to see him. Then she took another
look. She saw the crowd down by the corral, catching
and saddling unwilling horses. Women were
hurrying in and out of cabins, dragging household
goods and children with them.</p>
<p>The little crowd before the store she could not see
as the building itself prevented, but she saw Pachuca
with several of his men riding up and down, and she
also saw several unmounted Mexicans who had been
looting the store, carry the goods out and throw them
in the car which stood at the side of the building. Instinctively
the girl reconstructed the action of the bandits.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of them came on horseback and the rest in
the car. They&#8217;re going to carry what they&#8217;ve taken in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the car and they&#8217;re taking the horses for the extra
men. Our Mexicans and their women are going with
them and are helping themselves to whatever they
want. But where are our men? I didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d
sit down and be plundered without putting up some
kind of a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw the crowd which had been looting the store
start for the corral. The car stood alone. Without
doubt they had stopped it a little way from the street
and made a dash on horseback. Polly&#8217;s eyes shone.</p>
<p>She glanced at the sun; it was going down rapidly.
It would soon be dusk. She crept cautiously out of
the arroyo. If only none of the men on horseback saw
her she might manage it, wild as her plan was. She
shook with fear but she did not falter; a girl does not
have an obstinate chin for nothing. She glanced both
ways; Pachuca was still riding up and down, issuing
orders which were obeyed noisily but cheerfully. She
saw him point toward the corral and saw the men who
had been loading the car with plunder start toward the
corral on a run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going after more horses,&#8221; thought the girl, stopping
and crouching back of one of the cabins. If they
should see her&mdash;she held her breath. The next moment
she was running for the car, still sheltered by
the cabins. It was this moment that Scott chose to
walk down the street and draw the attention of the
raiders. Polly saw him and her heart warmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew he wasn&#8217;t a coward!&#8221; she almost sobbed.
&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad&mdash;but he needn&#8217;t be such an idiot as
that. He&#8217;ll be shot as sure as I&#8217;m here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>Panic stricken, she increased her pace and in a minute
had reached the shelter of the car. Then the shots
burst upon her ears. She turned white and clung to
the door of the car. If they had killed him! She saw
Scott&#8217;s face as he had left her&mdash;friendly, ugly, determined&mdash;and
she knew that if they had killed him
nothing else would matter&mdash;anything might happen
and she would not care. Mechanically, she opened the
door of the car and hastily moved some of the plunder
from the floor to the seat. The Mexicans had tossed
in canned goods, blankets, rifles, a couple of cash
boxes and even a box of victrola records. Then she
crawled into the space she had made and seizing one of
the blankets, drew it over herself and over a part of
the loot, giving the tonneau of the car the appearance
of being full of plunder which was protected from the
dust by a blanket.</p>
<p>There was a clatter of hoofs and Polly heard Scott&#8217;s
parting yell. It brought a glorious relief to her mind
for surely no one who was badly hurt could be as mad
as that! She heard the answering yells of the Mexicans,
then she felt and heard the door of the car flung
open; someone had jumped in and was starting the
engine. Something struck her&mdash;a man had thrown his
bundle into the car that he might take a howling
youngster on his saddle. Polly&#8217;s teeth chattered with
fear; she was realizing with every throb of the engine
the awful risk she was taking.</p>
<p>Suddenly the car moved. Polly cowered in her uncomfortable
position. Cold with terror she clutched
the revolver Scott had given her. Suppose at the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
minute some of the other men should decide to get into
the car?</p>
<p>&#8220;But I won&#8217;t suppose! There wouldn&#8217;t have been
any time to suppose if I&#8217;d gone to war to drive an
ambulance. The boys didn&#8217;t suppose when they went
over the top&mdash;they just went! I hope to goodness
none of these guns I&#8217;m sitting on are loaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car bumped along on the rutty road and the
noise of the riders died away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; the girl said triumphantly. &#8220;I knew
the horseback people would take to the trail as soon
as they could, and the automobile can&#8217;t, of course.
I&#8217;ve scored one point&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The car stopped. Polly&#8217;s breathing apparatus
stopped simultaneously. What was it? Had he seen
her? Or was he about to pull the loot to pieces and
discover her? She listened with her whole body, but
heard nothing from the driver. Instead, came the
detonation of the dynamited tracks. The ground beneath
the car trembled. Then she heard the man
laugh as he started the car again.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve blown up something! That sounds like
Don Juan&#8217;s voice, too. If I could only see!&#8221;</p>
<p>The car soon moved at its former speed. On and
on it went. Sometimes the road would be smooth, the
driver having found wagon ruts and stayed in them.
Again, it would be full of bumps and jars. It was
very uncomfortable, her position being wretchedly
cramped. Once she was startled to hear the driver
break into song. It sounded like a Spanish love song
and his voice was a lyric tenor and very musical. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
was Pachuca! She determined to know what was going
on.</p>
<p>Pushing aside a corner of the blanket she saw that
it was beginning to grow dusky. Cautiously she raised
herself until she could see. Pachuca was bent over
the wheel. Looking back she saw the road empty of
riders.</p>
<p>She looked ahead again. They were in the foothills
already. Polly drew a long breath, then leaning
over the back of the seat said desperately:</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Pachuca, would you mind turning round a
moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>If she had exploded the revolver in his ear, Pachuca
could not have given a greater start.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Madre di Dios!</i>&#8221; he gasped, as the machine
swerved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, do mind the wheel&mdash;that was an awful
curve!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; demanded the young
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been hidden among the stolen goods,&#8221; replied
Polly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a lot about you lately, señor,
but I honestly didn&#8217;t believe you were a thief until I
saw with my own eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca stopped the machine and turning glared at
the girl, also at the weapon which she pointed with a
very unsteady hand in his direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll put that thing down I&#8217;ll try to explain to
you the difference between stealing and requisitioning
property in war times,&#8221; he said, angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll turn the car around you can explain all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
the way back to Athens,&#8221; said Polly, sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;m
awfully tired and stiff and my hand is shaky&mdash;the man
who gave me this gun told me it was ready to go off.
I don&#8217;t want it to go off but if it does I can&#8217;t help it.
Will you please turn around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t. The road is too narrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve turned a Red Cross ambulance around in a
lane no wider than this out near Fort Sheridan and I
didn&#8217;t spill anybody either. You&#8217;re a better driver
than I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca shrugged his shoulders but he turned the
car. There was an ugly look in his eyes and Polly
clutched her weapon tightly. She tried to keep her
voice steady but it quavered desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you try to do anything mean&mdash;upset the car or
anything like that, I&#8217;m going to fire&mdash;I certainly will&mdash;as
sure as I&#8217;m red-headed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car sped on. Suddenly Pachuca&#8217;s shoulders began
to shake. He turned a laughing face toward
Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so pretty and so disagreeable,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Are all Chicago ladies like you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Some of them are not so pretty and are
more agreeable,&#8221; replied the girl, nervously. &#8220;Please&mdash;you
just missed that chuck-hole!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I care? I do not want to go to
Athens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you don&#8217;t want to go to Heaven, either, do
you? Or&mdash;well, you know what I mean. I don&#8217;t
know how much of a jar it would take to make this
thing go off. A chuck-hole might do it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>Pachuca, evidently depressed, relapsed into silence.
It was growing colder and darker&mdash;would they never
get there? However, she would not have been Polly
had she kept still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Pachuca, what did you mean by requisitioning
goods? You aren&#8217;t working for the government,
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has another revolution broken out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear young lady, Sonora has seceded and
other states will follow. Mexico is about to throw off
Carranza and his government. Is that clear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty clear&mdash;only I don&#8217;t understand why you
should take our things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am raising a regiment. When it is complete I
shall lead it into the field to fight for Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. That&#8217;s why you wanted our men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A regiment means men, señorita.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And our blankets and money and guns and victrola
records?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? You Americans make your profit from
us, why should you not share in our obligations? Did
your generals spare the South when you had your Civil
War? War is not a pretty thing, señorita.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were at war with the South and they
took&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. They took. An American has but one
code of morals, and that is to take. I do not quarrel
with it, I like it. I also take.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly did not reply. She was tired and cold and
she wanted to get home. Her hand was cramped and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
shaky&mdash;her threat had not been an idle one. She realized
also that Pachuca for all his docility was only
waiting the opportunity to turn the tables on her. He
was a young man most fertile in expedients and it behooved
her to be extremely vigilant. He would be
quite capable of shooting up the wrong road and carrying
her miles in a strange direction.</p>
<p>The thought made her feel panicky. She tried to
remember the turns in the road, only to realize that
she had not seen the road&mdash;she had been in the bottom
of the car, her head covered with a blanket when she
had traveled it so short a time ago. Everything looked
ghostly and unreal to her in the half light, while Pachuca,
she firmly believed, could see in the dark with
those handsome eyes of his quite as well as any family
cat out for a run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go faster, please,&#8221; she said, sharply, for wherever
they were going it might be as well to get there before
dark. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting late and I&#8217;m cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obediently Pachuca swung into the next speed and
the car bumped cheerfully along, the big lights casting
a bewildering glare before them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I only knew where we were and what he has up
his sleeve!&#8221; the girl groaned inwardly. &#8220;I know he
has something because he isn&#8217;t making any fuss. This
road is rougher than it was when we came, too; he has
taken a wrong turn&mdash;I know he has!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca, apparently resigned to his fate, began to
hum melodiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor!&#8221; Polly&#8217;s voice was sharp with apprehension
and weariness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Señorita?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on the wrong road; I am sure of it. Go
back to the place where you left it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With perfect willingness, dear lady, but where
shall I go? The road leads to Athens. Is that not
where we want to go&mdash;I mean where you want to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I think you&#8217;re tricking me.
This isn&#8217;t the way we came. It doesn&#8217;t look to me like
a road at all&mdash;I think you&#8217;re going over the open country.
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The girl paused. It was disheartening&mdash;to
go through so much and then to fail at last. She
peered ahead into the dim light, trying to see what lay
beyond the bright lights of the car. It did look like
open country. Ahead lay a hill&mdash;a tall hill. Would
Pachuca try to make it or would he climb around the
side of it? Something&mdash;it looked like a man on horseback&mdash;was
coming rapidly down the hill. Had she
miscalculated and were some of Pachuca&#8217;s men still
on the road? Perhaps the same thought struck the
Mexican, for he slowed the car down and peered
eagerly ahead. Polly clutched the revolver feverishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s one of your men and you stop&mdash;I shall fire!&#8221;
she said, quickly.</p>
<p>Both stared into the dusk in silence. The rider came
almost into the glare of the lamps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried the girl, loudly. &#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Scott!&#8221;</p>
<p>The car stopped, the horse was drawn to his
haunches, and Scott stared at the couple over his
gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Game&#8217;s up, Pachuca,&#8221; he said, shortly. &#8220;You&#8217;re
my prisoner.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Polly, jumping out of the car and running
to Scott. &#8220;I knew he hadn&#8217;t killed you&mdash;but I
wouldn&#8217;t ask him for fear he&#8217;d say he had! I
knew&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She clutched his stirrup desperately.</p>
<p>Scott stared. &#8220;Well. I&#8217;m&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; he said, and reaching
down he caught the swaying girl by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to faint&mdash;I never do,&#8221; she cried,
clinging to his arm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep him covered. He&#8217;s not going to get away.&#8221;
Scott swung himself out of the saddle, wound the bridle
reins around the pommel and gave the horse a clap
which started him toward home. &#8220;Well, old man, I&#8217;ll
take the gun, I reckon. Thanks. What&#8217;s up? Getting
up a revolution?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t have to; it&#8217;s already got up,&#8221; said Polly,
as she climbed into her place again. &#8220;I hid in the car
and made him come back,&#8221; she added. &#8220;But I was
afraid we were off the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were,&#8221; said Scott, briefly. &#8220;I saw your lights
from the hilltop and came over this way. He was putting
one over on you all right.&#8221; He tossed into the
back of the car some of the stuff which was in his way
and took the seat beside Pachuca who preserved a sullen
silence. &#8220;Well, I guess we&#8217;ve had enough of
this. Home, James!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was not much conversation. Pachuca was in
a bad humor and confined his attention to the wheel, a
precaution which the increasing darkness rendered
highly prudent; Scott was intent upon watching the
young Mexican, determined to have no tricks played
upon him; while Polly, exhausted by the excitement of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
the past hour, crouched quietly in the crowded tonneau.
A long way in the rear the patient pony trotted
on his homeward way, wondering, no doubt, why
things that moved on wheels could go so much faster
than those traveling on plain, old-fashioned legs.</p>
<p>Out of the dark came a figure on horseback&mdash;as
unexpectedly as Scott himself had done a few moments
ago. Scott tightened his grasp on his revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s a friend of yours, señor, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll
have to go by without recognizing him,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not,&#8221; replied Pachuca. &#8220;My friends are
better horsemen than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Tom,&#8221; laughed Scott, suddenly. &#8220;He&#8217;s come
after me. Slow down, señor, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson, riding rapidly, swerved suddenly to one
side as the big machine without lights came toward
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s us,&#8221; said Scott, drily. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made a
haul and we&#8217;re bringing it in. Suppose you wait for
that horse of mine, will you, Tom, and see that he gets
home all right? Thanks to this gentleman and his
friends we&#8217;ve only got three head of cattle left, so
we&#8217;d best be careful of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; responded Johnson, heartily. &#8220;How&#8217;d
you do it, old man?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t, the lady in the case did it,&#8221; responded
Scott. &#8220;She&#8217;ll tell you about it later. Whoop her up,
will you, señor? It&#8217;s getting chilly around here.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Athens was dark and lonely-looking as the big machine
reëntered it. There was the usual light in the
store and one in the house occupied by Mrs. Van Zandt
and Polly. Scott motioned to Pachuca to draw up in
front of the cabin. Mrs. Van Zandt came out as the
machine stopped; evidently she was in doubt as to
whether or not it was another invasion, for she stopped
in the doorway and peered out anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Mrs. Van!&#8221; cried Scott, cheerfully.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought her back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly jumped out and ran to the astonished woman.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she reiterated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see it is; but where did you get that car?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Señor Pachuca&#8217;s and we&#8217;ve got him, too,&#8221; replied
the girl, in an undertone. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve brought
back some of the things they took.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Hard come back?&#8221; demanded Scott, as Mrs.
Van came out to the machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and I wish he would. I&#8217;m worried about
Jimmy Adams. Where are you going to put that
chap?&#8221; asked Mrs. Van, eyeing Pachuca resentfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll ask him to spend the night in Hard&#8217;s
office,&#8221; replied Scott, thoughtfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only place
we&#8217;ve got that isn&#8217;t on the ground floor, and I guess
nobody wants to put in the night doing sentry duty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Just bring over a couple of blankets, will you, Mrs.
Van?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt and Polly went into the house and
Scott with his prisoner walked across to the office
where they fell in with O&#8217;Grady, who grinned pleasantly
when the state of affairs was explained to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back to spend the night with us? Sure we
can make him comfy! Up-stairs, son. You can have
the engineer&#8217;s office to yourself,&#8221; he added, hospitably.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like leaving you here, Pachuca,&#8221; said Scott,
as he threw open the door of Hard&#8217;s office. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
my idea of entertaining the aristocracy, but it&#8217;s the best
I can do for a gentleman of your peculiar habits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your idea?&#8221; remarked Pachuca, surveying
the small room nonchalantly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think
it would be more practical to let me go? I can&#8217;t do
any more harm to-day, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Scott,
quietly. &#8220;I know you can&#8217;t do any harm to anyone
but yourself while you&#8217;re locked up here, and I want
to turn you over in my mind a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it worth your while to let me drive that
car off the place while you&#8217;re all asleep,&#8221; proposed Pachuca,
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a persuasive cuss, but we need that car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to do a little banditing on our own hook,&#8221;
put in O&#8217;Grady, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Matt! We&#8217;ll send you over some supper,
Pachuca, and some bedding by and by,&#8221; and locking
the door behind them, the two men went downstairs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You think he can&#8217;t slide out?&#8221; suggested Matt,
doubtfully. &#8220;He&#8217;s a crafty devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he wants to risk breaking a bone or two jumping
out of the window, let him try,&#8221; said Scott, easily.
&#8220;How&#8217;s Williams?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good. No bones broke and Mrs. Van
bandaged him up. He&#8217;s sore as the devil about his
stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We got a good deal of it back. We&#8217;ll run the car
down to the store and see just what we did get.&#8221; And
Scott related Polly&#8217;s adventure with much enjoyment.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a mighty game youngster,&#8221; declared
O&#8217;Grady, admiringly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know they raised &#8217;em
like that in the East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll swear I didn&#8217;t. Lucky for His Nobs she didn&#8217;t
let a bullet into him by mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a case of &#8216;eventually, why
not now?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>A search of the machine revealed the more important
part of the loot&mdash;the money taken from the
safe in the office, Williams&#8217; cash box, and a good many
firearms, blankets and small items. Horses, saddles,
bridles, canned goods and innumerable other effects
had been carried off by the horseback riders, never to
be regained, unless, as Scott suggested, Pachuca could
be traded off for them. And, of course, the mine
would have to be closed down until more workers
could be obtained, rather an improbable thing in the
present state of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;What beats me is, how did you happen to think
of it?&#8221; demanded O&#8217;Grady of Polly a little later as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
they sat around the dining-room table eating a hastily
improvised supper.</p>
<p>Polly chuckled. &#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; she said, modestly,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve been having a lot of auto hold-ups in
Chicago this winter and one of them happened to a
friend of mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;She and a friend were coming home from a party
one afternoon, and when she drew up at the house,
two young men popped into the car, pointed revolvers
at her and told her to drive up the avenue. Well, she
drove up the avenue! She said the feel of that cold
thing on the back of her neck kept her awake at night
for months. Then when they had gone a little way,
they stopped, dumped both the women out, and went
off with the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, Chicago must be a great little place!&#8221; remarked
Matt, admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just came to me when I saw them putting all
those things into the car that if anybody could hide in
it and make whoever was driving return the goods it
would be&mdash;well&mdash;rather a nice thing to do. Of course,
I took an awful chance. The horseback people might
not have taken the trail&mdash;but even then the machine
would have outdistanced them. I felt sure I could get
Pachuca alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You took a chance you&#8217;d no business to take,&#8221;
growled Scott. &#8220;When I told you to stay down in
that arroyo, I meant stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you did but I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; apologized Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing you did wrong was not leaving that
young reptile in the middle of the road like the thieves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
did those women,&#8221; pronounced Mrs. Van Zandt, authoritatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of it but I didn&#8217;t have the heart,&#8221; said
Polly. &#8220;After all, he&#8217;d been kind to me, and he is a
gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentleman! My God!&#8221; Scott&#8217;s profanity was
innocent with true horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;First time I ever heard a hoss-thief called a gentleman,&#8221;
chuckled Matt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Polly looked a bit crestfallen. &#8220;I mean,
he&#8217;s educated and he comes of good family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t go much on family,&#8221; said Mrs. Van, wisely.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen some mighty mean skunks hangin&#8217; around
stage doors who were as blue-blooded as dogs in a
show. Why, even your own family you can&#8217;t be too
sure about! I had an old auntie who used to say
she never went back of second cousins&mdash;&#8217;twasn&#8217;t
safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true, too,&#8221; pronounced Matt. &#8220;Some
don&#8217;t feel easy even with seconds.&#8221; He gathered up
his dishes and followed Mrs. Van into the kitchen with
them. Polly ate industriously, while Scott stalked to
the window and stood lighting a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Scott,&#8221; she said, after a long pause, &#8220;are you
worried about Jimmy Adams?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; was the curt reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a doctor in Conejo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but he&#8217;s a dirty scoundrel; I&#8217;d hate to have
him handle a case like this. We may have to, though,
thanks to your gentleman friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rather a rude person, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so. Anyhow, if he&#8217;s a gentleman, I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;d never pass muster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; persisted Polly, pleasantly, &#8220;you will admit
that he is agreeable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreeable nothing!&#8221; growled Scott. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
disreputable young varmint, and no decent girl ought
to speak to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly smiled and rising, gathered up her plate and
cup and carried them to the hole in the wall. Then
she walked over to the window and said confidentially:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be fun if you would tell me some
of the things he&#8217;s done. Not the yarn about the
actress and the man higher up&mdash;Mr. Hard told me that&mdash;but
some other really exciting ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sufficiently interested in the chap,&#8221; replied
Scott, gruffly. &#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;d like to carry him his
dinner and ask him to tell you himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would,&#8221; replied the girl, promptly. &#8220;I thought
perhaps you were thinking of starving him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t care to starve him. I want to swap
him off for our horses, if I can. He ain&#8217;t worth a
dozen or two good horses, but we can try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, we have the car to make things
square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have the car, in case we have to quit in a
hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit? You mean before Bob comes back?&#8221; the
girl&#8217;s face was a bit scared.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may get orders to close up the mine. You
heard what he said&mdash;that the state had seceded? Well,
that means civil war, and civil war in Mexico can mean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
a good many things. I&#8217;m not sure that I want two
women on my hands under the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about, Marc Scott? Is it a
Yaqui rising?&#8221; Mrs. Van Zandt thrust her head
through the hole in the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it is. Pachuca says there&#8217;s a
revolution on. I&#8217;m hoping to get more news about it
when Hard comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t take much stock in these Yaqui yarns,&#8221;
said Matt, coming back with another supply of food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them Indians ain&#8217;t half as bad as the greasers like to
make out. Of course, they feel like they had a right
to raise thunder now and then because they know they
ain&#8217;t been treated white. But you take it from me,
I&#8217;ve been knockin&#8217; around Mexico for some time, and
nine times out of ten there&#8217;s a greaser back of everything
that&#8217;s laid at a Yaqui&#8217;s door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough,&#8221; nodded Mrs. Van.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made up my mind when I read in that El Paso
paper that there was going to be a Yaqui rising and
that the gov&#8217;ment was orderin&#8217; troops into Sonora, that
the gov&#8217;ment most probably had somethin&#8217; up its
sleeve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most likely,&#8221; acceded Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t expect to understand Mexican politics,&#8221;
said Polly, &#8220;but why, if Mr. Carranza wants to
be president again, doesn&#8217;t he come out like a little man
and say so, instead of trying to stir up things with
troops?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t be president again. The constitution under
which he took office forbids a second term,&#8221; replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
Scott. &#8220;He might be military dictator, however, if he
stirred up a revolution and came out on top. That&#8217;s
what the Sonora people say. But you can&#8217;t tell; it
may be a square deal and there may be a Yaqui
rising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even then this ain&#8217;t the place for women folks,&#8221;
grumbled O&#8217;Grady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor men neither,&#8221; retorted Mrs. Van Zandt.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to get Mr. Herrick on the &#8217;phone to
let him know there was trouble on board, but I couldn&#8217;t
even get Central.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pachuca would attend to that, of course,&#8221; said
Scott. &#8220;We&#8217;ll drive over there in the morning and
see if he doesn&#8217;t want to come back with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I really going to see that fascinating person?&#8221;
sighed Polly. &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to think he&#8217;s just hot
air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty little hot air about old Herrick,&#8221; chuckled
Matt. &#8220;All wool and a yard wide, I&#8217;d say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he is. That&#8217;s more than I&#8217;d say about a
good many artistic chaps,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Van.
&#8220;Most of &#8217;em I hate&mdash;they&#8217;re so crooked. The Lord
starts &#8217;em weak and the women finish &#8217;em. He sure
can play, though. Regular pictures&mdash;some of the
things he composes. I can see the cows grazing on the
hills in some of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How queer of him to stay down here!&#8221; said the
girl, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Scott, warmly. &#8220;It seems to
me that a country like this has a lot more to offer
that kind of man than your cities have. What&#8217;s New
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
York or Chicago got to give him like these grim old
mountains, and the lonesome little canyons with the
cows feeding up and down hunting for water holes,
and the Mexican folks with their soft voices and fancy
manners and all the rest of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cows are queer,&#8221; continued Mrs. Van, pursuing
her own thought cheerfully. &#8220;Ever see the old ones
get between you and the calves when you rode by &#8217;em?
Awful kind of human, they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott chuckled. &#8220;One summer I was up in New
Mexico on a ranch when they were rounding up.
They brought in the cattle from all over the place; for
days they were getting in strays out of the canyons.
Among them were two old bulls. Funny old codgers
they were, and as much alike as two peas in a pod&mdash;fat,
chunky, ragged looking old rascals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, all during the round-up those old boys
stayed together&mdash;in the bull pen and out. We named
them Tweedledum and Tweedledee. By George, after
they&#8217;d been turned out on the range again, I was riding
down a canyon about a couple of miles from the ranch,
and who should I see but those two old pals, hoofing
it together as chummy as two old men walking in the
park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how&#8217;s the chow?&#8221; Johnson&#8217;s voice came
from the doorway. &#8220;Not much left, I should
say, judging from the happy faces I see around
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Tommy, I&#8217;m just gettin&#8217; something ready
for that Mexican, but there&#8217;s plenty for you,&#8221; said
Mrs. Van.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you put the feller?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Hard&#8217;s office,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;Will you cart him
his grub, Matt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said I might. I want to,&#8221; protested Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221; Scott handed her the key ceremoniously.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve earned the right to have your own
way to-night, but Matt goes with you. He&#8217;s not above
throttling you to make a getaway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a funny world,&#8221; mused Polly, as she walked
along beside Matt, who carried the tray balanced aloft
on one outstretched palm. &#8220;Three weeks ago I was
going to teas at the Blackstone; now I&#8217;m carrying grub
to a Mexican bandit with the assistance of a fireman.
How awfully well you carry that tray!&#8221; she said, admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Learned to do that one winter in Minneapolis
when I was out of a job. Handy sort of thing
to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped the girl. Then to herself: &#8220;Why
should I think it queer? Cousin Ben put himself
through college by waiting on the students at table
and we thought he had a lot of pep to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go on up and holler to the guy that we&#8217;re
coming but don&#8217;t you open the door till I get there.
He might paste you one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly complied. She sprang up the stairs with a
freedom of motion that won O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s silent admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some action!&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Takes them
stairs as easy as a pussy-cat goes up a tree. Some
girl that! Old Scotty&#8217;s jealous of the greaser&mdash;do him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
good&mdash;he&#8217;s gettin&#8217; to be a regular old settin&#8217; hen. Hope
she shakes him up a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Pachuca!&#8221; called Polly at the top of the
stairs. &#8220;We&#8217;ve brought you some supper. May we
come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracias, señorita, but that rests with you,&#8221; was the
response.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to open it. He won&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; said
Polly, decidedly.</p>
<p>The room was dimly lighted. In the open window
sat Pachuca&mdash;outside lay the open country, moonlit
and lovely, the grim coloring of the day now touched
with silvery softness. Pachuca leaped to his feet and
relieved the girl of the tray which he placed on the
desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am obliged,&#8221; he said, with a touch of a sneer.
&#8220;The services of a major domo and a beautiful waitress
are more than I expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ask me, I&#8217;d say it was more than you deserve,&#8221;
replied Matt, tersely. &#8220;I&#8217;m going out to sit
on the stairs. If the lady wants to stop and visit with
you she can, but don&#8217;t you try no monkey tricks because
they won&#8217;t go down. I&#8217;m heeled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca shrugged his shapely shoulders, seated himself
and began to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am hungry,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I have had what
you call a hard day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said the girl, severely, &#8220;that you&#8217;d tell
me why you do such things? You&#8217;re a gentleman&mdash;not
a bandit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m not a bandit.&#8221; Pachuca&#8217;s composure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
appeared to be deserting him. &#8220;You do not seem
to understand&mdash;you Americans&mdash;that Mexico is our
country and that we must deal with its political situations
independently of you and your affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; innocently, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that political situations
demanded blankets and victrola records.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must make allowances for my people. They
are poor and ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the people we complain about. They only
do what you tell them to. Why should you come and
tell them to stop working for us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In your country it is only the walking delegate who
does that?&#8221; grinned Pachuca.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different. This wasn&#8217;t a strike. These
men didn&#8217;t want to stop work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear girl, you seem to have lost sight of the
fact that a revolution is taking place. It is their duty
to stop working and to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It always seems to be their duty to fight and they
never get anything out of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They do get something out of it. They got their
land when they overthrew Diaz. With Carranza, they
got a new constitution. With Obregon, they will get
peace and a good government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are for Obregon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally. But I must have men and horses and
munitions. I&mdash;Juan Pachuca&mdash;cannot fight in the
ranks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why not,&#8221; said Polly, candidly. &#8220;My
brother fought in the ranks and he&#8217;s a college man.
He didn&#8217;t mind.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, in America&mdash;that is different! You have
no ideas as to family. I beg your pardon, what I mean
is, that your people are different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope we are,&#8221; replied Polly, piously.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m afraid some of us aren&#8217;t as different as we
ought to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we are even,&#8221; said the Mexican, showing his
white teeth. &#8220;And you know why I took your men
and horses. They will be made good to you when the
country becomes settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, but it seems to me you&#8217;re going to have
so many people to settle with that some of us are going
to come out at the little end. Of course, your car will
help some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca frowned. &#8220;Señorita,&#8221; he said, gravely, &#8220;I
must have the car and I must get away from here to-night.
Much depends upon it. Won&#8217;t you help me?&#8221;
He leaned toward her as he spoke, his dark eyes luminous,
his voice soft and caressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tiger kitty is purring,&#8221; thought Polly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a nice kitty but I mustn&#8217;t pet it. Señor,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say rather that you won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly fingered the key which she had taken from
Matt. Then she put it in the pocket of her sweater.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be easy,&#8221; said Pachuca, persuasively.
&#8220;You could throw it into the window there when
everyone was asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be easy,&#8221; agreed Polly, &#8220;but it wouldn&#8217;t
be nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca ate for a moment in silence. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
he said, finally, &#8220;that an American girl never does
anything that is not nice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d hardly go as far as to say that,&#8221; replied
Polly, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d find many who would
be as dishonest as&mdash;oh, what&#8217;s the use? You know I&#8217;d
like to do it for you because you were kind to me, and
I do not believe you meant to kidnap me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kidnap you!&#8221; wrathfully. &#8220;Who said I meant to
kidnap you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nobody, only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca began to laugh; gently at first, then wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is jealous&mdash;that good Marc Scott! He told
you I wanted to kidnap you&mdash;like Villa, eh? Does he
think a Spanish gentleman so unattractive that he has
to kidnap a young lady in order to make love to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what he thinks and I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said
Polly, angrily. &#8220;And I wouldn&#8217;t have come here if I
had thought you were going to be foolish. I wanted to
show you that I wasn&#8217;t ungrateful&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca had jumped to his feet and stood between
her and the door. His manner was respectful and
apologetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Señorita, I beg your pardon! Indeed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not necessary,&#8221; said the girl, coldly, trying to
pass him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, I beg&mdash;do not go.&#8221; Then, in a lower tone,
&#8220;I had a double reason for asking your help. I can be
of help to you and to your brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly paused in some surprise. From the stairway
came the sound of energetic whistling&mdash;a medley of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
&#8220;Wearin&#8217; of the Green&#8221; and the &#8220;Long, Long Trail.&#8221;
Pachuca continued eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it sounds very extravagant, I know; what my
brother-in-law used to call a bit thick. But I can help
you&mdash;to a treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A treasure?&#8221; incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. You have heard that I was for a time
with Villa?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in his camp I met some very strange people&mdash;among
them a fellow named Gasca&mdash;what you call a
bad lot. He told me one night when he was very
drunk&mdash;you know, señorita, how some people talk
about their affairs when they are drunk?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s eyes were beginning to shine with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me that he and his brother had hidden a
treasure over in New Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A treasure! Do you mean pieces-of-eight and
Spanish doubloons?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I am afraid not. It would be bullion&mdash;ore.
They took it from one of the Fiske, Doane Co.
mines in Chihuahua. That is why your brother would
be interested. Perhaps you have heard of the Sant
Ynez mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bullion!&#8221; Polly&#8217;s face dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, I would not object to bullion if I could get
my hands on it, but I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Pachuca, candidly.
&#8220;Gasca, you understand, had this brother who lived in
New Mexico, in a lonely sort of a spot on the border,
with an Indian woman that he had stolen from her
people. He helped Gasca get the treasure across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
the border&mdash;and they hid it in the canyon where he
lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shortly after that they quarreled and the brother
threatened to shoot Gasca if he came near the place.
Also, he told the border patrol some things about Gasca
so that he was afraid to go over any more. Just after
I met Gasca, he had heard, in a roundabout way as my
people hear things, that the brother had been killed and
the Indian woman had died of a sickness. Gasca
wanted me to go over with him to find out if the treasure
was still there&mdash;he felt sure that it was because he
said the brother would be afraid to dispose of it without
his help&mdash;but I had what you call other fish to fry.
Afterward, Gasca himself was shot for disobeying a
command of the general. If you will help me to
get away I will tell you exactly where that treasure
is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly rose suddenly, the light of determination in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, firmly. &#8220;I won&#8217;t. Mr. O&#8217;Grady,
will you come and help me with this tray, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure Mike!&#8221; In two strides the fireman was in
the room, his eyes looking searchingly at both the man
and the girl. Pachuca, with a shrug of his shoulders,
put his hands in his pockets and strode to the window.
The dishes were piled up in silence, the door was
locked&mdash;the key returning to Polly&#8217;s sweater pocket,
and the two went back to the dining-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, was that guy tryin&#8217; to get fresh with you?&#8221;
demanded Matt, as they went along. &#8220;I set out there
on the steps because I thought mebbe you wanted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
chat with the crittur, being acquaintances like, but if
I&#8217;d of thought that he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, he was trying to bribe me to let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him go? Well, if he ain&#8217;t got a nerve! What&#8217;d
he offer you&mdash;a castle in Spain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the girl, &#8220;a buried treasure in New
Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Well, say, he must have thought you was
green to fall for that stuff. A bright, wide-awake girl
like you, too. Was it under an elm tree fifty paces off
by moonlight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? Couldn&#8217;t there be a buried treasure in New
Mexico?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose there could if there&#8217;s been a fool
to bury it; but it seems to me I&#8217;d of tried something
snappier if I&#8217;d been him. An oil well, or shares in a
gold mine, or somethin&#8217; first class in the bunk line.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>AT LIBERTY</h3>
</div>

<p>Polly and Matt continued their walk in silence until
they reached the dining-room. They found Scott sitting
as they had left him, smoking and thinking; while,
through the hole in the wall, Mrs. Van Zandt could be
seen and heard busy with the dishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did His Nobs enjoy his tea?&#8221; asked Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did that! Kicked into it like a little man,&#8221; replied
Matt, cheerfully. &#8220;Also he made the young lady
a real sporting proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be absurd!&#8221; snapped Polly, disgustedly.
&#8220;Anybody&#8217;d suppose you were college boys at thé dansant.&#8221; And she went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see what you get, Matt; you would horn
in. What do you mean&mdash;a sporting proposition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a rich one. Buried treasure up in New Mexico&mdash;secret
chart handed down to Juan Pachuca by a
maiden aunt&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what all&mdash;just to get the
key of the office, but she was too sharp for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hope so. Is that Hard?&#8221; Scott went to
the window as the sound of hoof-beats was heard.
Down the street came a man on horseback. Silhouetted
against the moonlight, the tall Bostonian acquired
a picturesqueness lacking in daylight. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
take Hard out one of these days and teach him how to
ride,&#8221; remarked Scott, meditatively. &#8220;Jolt some of
that Boston stiffness out of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the Irishman, placidly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
in his blood. His ancestors brought it over in the
<i>Mayflower</i> with &#8217;em from England. I&#8217;ll bet you Paul
Revere rode just like Hard does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks, Matt, those English guys can ride&mdash;stands
to reason they can. Look at the cross-country stuff
they do! And on an English saddle at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Country? The country they ride over&#8217;s nothing to
what the Irish do. A feller told me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, boys, what&#8217;s up? Why the theatre supper?&#8221;
demanded Hard, entering.</p>
<p>He listened to the particulars which poured upon
him. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, finally, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I missed the
excitement. &#8217;Twas ever thus. The only time our
house ever burned down I was at a matinée of the
&#8216;Black Crook.&#8217; Well, you saved the cash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Polly did,&#8221; grinned Scott. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve got
the boy that made the mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy much hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid something like this would happen,&#8221;
said Hard. &#8220;They told me over in Conejo that there
was trouble on. They had an all-night session at Hermosillo
and the state seceded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Pachuca says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan&#8217;s taken his family up to Douglas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any news from Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a letter for Miss Polly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t desert until we have orders, but I&#8217;m
rather glad to have the car,&#8221; continued Scott. &#8220;I
thought we&#8217;d run over and see Herrick in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Scott, that Chinaman of Herrick&#8217;s is a
doctor. Why not have him take a look at Jimmy&#8217;s
leg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Chinaman!&#8221; Polly had come in with Hard&#8217;s
coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; cried Scott. &#8220;Just the thing. I&#8217;d forgotten
about him. When a Chink is scientific, he&#8217;s as
scientific as the devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He came over to practice medicine; you know how
the Mexicans feel about the Chinese? His money
went and he had to do what he could. Herrick picked
him up somewhere and he&#8217;s been there ever since,&#8221; said
Hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get him over here for Jimmy. He&#8217;s clean
at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to this!&#8221; Polly had opened her letter.
&#8220;It&#8217;s from Mother,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Poor old Bob&#8217;s
in the hospital&mdash;just been operated on for appendicitis!
Isn&#8217;t that the limit? On a honeymoon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard luck,&#8221; commented Scott. &#8220;How&#8217;s he coming
on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She says he&#8217;s doing splendidly. You see, he&#8217;s been
dodging that operation for the last ten years, and now
it&#8217;s got him, poor boy. Mother says they&#8217;re worried to
death about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And well they may be,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Van Zandt,
heartily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She says the directors have met but didn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds natural,&#8221; said Hard. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been
doing that for the last three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to figure out which costs less; to give up
the property, or to pay us our salaries to hold it down,&#8221;
chuckled Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says I am to come home at once,&#8221; continued
Polly, &#8220;but that I am not to try to travel alone. Either
Mr. Scott or Mr. Hard is to go with me to the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad somebody in your family has got good
sense,&#8221; said Scott, grimly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity those things
aren&#8217;t hereditary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I think I prefer to have Mr. Hard
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard bowed solemnly. &#8220;Bob coming back?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as they&#8217;ll let him,&#8221; said Bob&#8217;s sister,
promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he likes a scrap,&#8221; remarked Scott. &#8220;I hope
they keep the papers away from him this next week.
Well, it&#8217;s lucky for you, Miss Polly, that we&#8217;ve got
Pachuca&#8217;s car. Traveling on these railroads is bad
enough at any time, but with a brand new revolution
on hand, it&#8217;ll be the deuce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s rather horrid of them not to care
whether I go home or not,&#8221; Polly told herself, as she
undressed for bed. &#8220;They might at least pretend they
don&#8217;t want me to go! I always supposed that the one
girl in a mining camp would be dazzlingly popular&mdash;but
this doesn&#8217;t look much like it. And yet&mdash;he likes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
me, I know he does! He liked my bringing the car
back; I saw it in his eyes, if he did make fun of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s jealous of Don Juan, too. Well, that won&#8217;t
do him any harm. He&#8217;s so determined not to fall in
love with me that he&#8217;s going to need a little outside interference
to make him change his mind. He&#8217;s got to
change his mind because I&mdash;yes, I do care for him&mdash;a
lot. People may think these things don&#8217;t come suddenly
outside of books, but they do&mdash;oh, they do!&#8221;
And, worn out by the exertions of the day, Polly curled
herself in a knot and prepared to sleep.</p>
<p>Juan Baptisto Pachuca had not availed himself of
the shakedown made for him by Mrs. Van Zandt&#8217;s
blankets. He had put out his light because he wanted
to think and he preferred thinking by moonlight. He
sat in Hard&#8217;s office chair by the window, closed now,
for the night was cool, and drummed impatiently upon
the arm of it.</p>
<p>Mentally, Pachuca was more than impatient; he was
outraged. His plans had been spoiled, his liberty restricted
and his dignity impaired. He had been made
to look ridiculous. Of all the offenses against him the
latter was the most serious. He hated giving up anything
he had put his mind on, but he hated a great deal
more being made ridiculous.</p>
<p>Nor was it pleasant to be triumphed over by a girl.
Juan Pachuca liked girls, especially good-looking ones,
but he liked them in their places, not in the larger
affairs of life. When they insisted upon mixing themselves
up with such affairs, they ceased, in his estimation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
to be pretty girls and became merely tiresome
members of the other sex.</p>
<p>Had Polly Street given in to his proposals of escape
he would have felt in a better temper with her, but he
would not have been at all tempted to fall in love with
her. He had been in the mood for that once&mdash;the
night they had come over from Conejo together&mdash;but
Fate, or the girl herself, or Marc Scott, he had hardly
taken the time to decide which, had interfered and that
was over.</p>
<p>Pachuca bore Polly no ill will for her part in that
affair. That was her province&mdash;a love affair. A lady
had the privilege of granting or denying her favors;
it was not always because she wanted to that she denied
them. He knew a good deal about that sort of thing
and he was willing to give and take very agreeably in
the game of love, without repining if things didn&#8217;t seem
to be going his way.</p>
<p>This, however, was a question of business and Juan
Pachuca considered that any woman who could get
ahead of him in a matter of business would have to
get up exceedingly early in the morning. He would
get out of that room or he would know the reason why.
It was highly important that he should. In fact, his
plans for the next few days depended absolutely upon
his so doing.</p>
<p>Pachuca&#8217;s business head, for all his conceit about it,
was exceedingly primitive. His had been rather a
primitive career from its beginning. Hard&#8217;s story of
the actress, while not entirely correct, had its foundation
in fact. Pachuca had been disgraced; to be disgraced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
in any manner is bad enough, but to be disgraced
for doing something that you know quite well
is being done in perfect security by most of the people
with whom you are connected is particularly galling.</p>
<p>Aching to thwart the government he hated, Pachuca
hastened to ally himself with its particular enemy and
to work against it with all the impetuosity of his nature.
But Francisco Villa was not an easy man for
anyone as heady as Juan Pachuca to get on with.
There were quarrels and more quarrels, and finally
Pachuca, again disgusted with the world and its people,
retired to private life.</p>
<p>He was not, however, built for private life. Some
of us are like that. We need the excitement and the
stimulus of action to bring out our better points. Also,
Pachuca&#8217;s friends were not of the sort who cared much
for the quiet life. In those few months of association
with the great Villa, he had met men of various kinds;
men who were honestly trying to do something for
Mexico; men who were dishonestly trying to do something
for themselves; and men who were in such a
truly desperate frame of mind after ten years of revolution,
banditry, and general upset, that they scarcely
knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>Pachuca, who for all his aristocratic blood, was an
exceedingly good mixer, had enjoyed these various and
sundry associations and in the quiet of private life he
yearned for them. Very much as a celebrated actress
feels the lure of the footlights after she has left them
for matrimony and the fireside, very much as the superannuated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
fire horse is said to react to the alarm, so
Pachuca yearned for the agreeable persons with whom
he had foregathered since leaving the army.</p>
<p>When there were rumors of another revolution, he
began to think of looking up some of these exceedingly
live wires, and seeing what could be done for Freedom,
Mexico, and Juan Pachuca. It was with the idea of
informing himself as to these matters that he had taken
the journey which had resulted in his meeting with
Polly Street, and the fortnight which she had spent in
Athens had been used to accomplish a number of
things.</p>
<p>Himself rather a good judge of which way the political
cat might be expected to jump at this particular
crisis, Pachuca had decided to throw in his lot with the
Obregonistas. He knew Obregon, knew his hold on
the people, his popularity with the labor party, and it
looked to him very much as though that general of
fascinating Irish ancestry had a good chance of being
Mexico&#8217;s next president.</p>
<p>At the same time he realized perfectly that his own
reputation with the Obregonistas was not good. Various
tales current among Mexicans of political standing,
in regard to his relations with Villa, would be very
much against him, and services rendered the Carranza
government would hardly be likely to stand him in
good stead. Pachuca wanted to stand well with the
new party if he stood with them at all. He intended
that the next president of Mexico should confer upon
him an office of distinction, and offices of this sort must
be earned, not only in Mexico but anywhere. In the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
great republic near by which Pachuca hoped some day
to visit, preferably on a state mission, things were handled
in this way also. If he could bring to the revolutionary
chiefs of the new party men, arms, and money,
he might hope for a warm reception.</p>
<p>During the fortnight referred to he had communicated
with one Angel Gonzales, previously mentioned,
who had also quarreled with Villa and been rigorously
persecuted by him. Gonzales was at the head of a
small band which he was quite willing to consolidate
with Pachuca&#8217;s men, and they had agreed to meet and
discuss ways and means. It was toward this rendezvous
that Pachuca had been journeying when he
stopped to raid the Athens mining camp.</p>
<p>To be stopped at such a time was not to be endured.
Pachuca looked around the small room angrily. He
looked out of the window. It was a bad drop but not
an impossible one. An athlete might manage it, he
supposed, but he was not an athlete&mdash;he was a gentleman
and a soldier. It would be a nasty thing to try it
and to break a leg. He had never tried breaking a leg
but he remembered having heard the family physician
say that a broken leg meant a six weeks&#8217; vacation and
he had no mind for a vacation on those terms.</p>
<p>He went to the door&mdash;locked, of course, he had
heard the girl turn the key, but one might burst it open.
He tried, several times, but the door held maddeningly.
There was no transom, no other door&mdash;nothing but the
plastered walls and the window. He turned again to
the window, and threw it open. The cool night air
came in refreshingly. In the distance, the dark shapes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
of the mountains stood out forbiddingly in the moonlight.
Millions of stars winked and twinkled. Gaunt
cacti reared their ungainly shapes&mdash;beautiful because
of their very ugliness.</p>
<p>Somewhere over in those mountains Angel Gonzales
was wending a torturous path to meet him. Angel
would swear and rage when he did not come. Then
he would probably annex Pachuca&#8217;s men and their
plunder and go cheerfully on his way. That would be
Angel&#8217;s idea of the philosophical manner of handling
the situation. Juan ground his white teeth in a fury.
Again he hung out of the window. The moonlight was
so glaring that he was easily visible had anyone been
watching, but all the lights in Athens were out and the
inhabitants in bed.</p>
<p>Pachuca swung lightly out of the window and with a
very cattish agility caught the sill with both hands and
lowered himself. He looked down. It was the devil
of a drop. Ten chances to one he would turn an ankle
at the very least. He made a wry face. One does not
do things successfully when one does them in this
frame of mind. With an effort surprising in one so
slight he drew himself back into the window again.
There must be another way. It was positively not on
the cards for him to be fooled in this stupid manner.
He could see his car standing near the corral and the
sight urged him to greater efforts.</p>
<p>He paced angrily up and down the floor. It was a
very solid floor. As far as he was concerned it might
be regarded as an invincible floor. If he had a pick,
perhaps&mdash;Pachuca&#8217;s eyes brightened, and a roguish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
look came into them. He had been thinking as he
often did in English, being practically bi-lingual, and
the word suggested something to him. Why not pick
the lock? He felt eagerly in his pocket for his knife&mdash;left,
alas, in the pocket of his leather coat in the machine.
Still, there might be one somewhere about. In
the desk, perhaps. The saints would help a good
Spaniard, undoubtedly. Pachuca was not unduly religious,
and he could not recall at the moment any saint
renowned for picking locks, so he let it go at that and
began to hunt. Some sort of tool might be found in
the desk.</p>
<p>The desk yielded pencils, pens, erasers, and other
harmless implements without number, but nothing even
remotely resembling a knife. Pachuca slammed the
drawers angrily and resumed his tramping. The night
was getting on and he was apparently no nearer freedom
than when the girl had left him. He cursed volubly
and disgustedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose if I had the shoulders of that abominable
Scott I could break the door!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;On the
other hand,&#8221; he mused, grimly, &#8220;if I had had his brains
I would not be here. It was a foolish business&mdash;trying
to confiscate American property. It rarely pays.&#8221;
Pachuca, like the famous Mr. Pecksniff, believed in
keeping up appearances even with one&#8217;s self. His attempt
was confiscation distinctly and not robbery. &#8220;It
was talking with the American girl that day on the
train that put it into my head. She would talk about
her brother and his mine. Juan Pachuca, when will
you learn to let women alone? Every time a woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
comes upon the scene something disagreeable happens&mdash;and
usually to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused by the window and surveyed it distastefully.
&#8220;If I have to go out by that window, I will&mdash;but
I do not like it. If I could bribe someone to put up
a ladder! But they are all asleep&mdash;the lazy fools.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at the shakedown which Mrs. Van Zandt
had sent over by Miller, the idea of a rope ladder made
of sheets having floated idly through his head. Alas,
the shakedown consisted of a small hard mattress and a
couple of blankets, army blankets at that. Anyone
who can make a rope ladder of army blankets, with
nothing more solid to fasten them to than a rickety old
desk, must be cleverer than even Juan Pachuca considered
himself.</p>
<p>With a sigh of surrender he returned to the window.
It was the only way; broken bones or no broken bones,
it must be attempted. If he were unlucky enough to
meet with disaster, he must crawl as far as the car, and
once in the car he defied anyone, white, brown or black
to stop him. If only they had left him his gun!</p>
<p>Carefully Pachuca balanced himself once more on
the window and swung himself out, still clinging to the
sill. The drop looked easier than it had before; he
felt almost cheerful about it. Give him five minutes
alone in the moonlight and he would have his liberty,
his car and his triumph over Gringo carelessness. At
the same moment, there arose out of the stillness the
loud and penetrating bark of an aroused dog.</p>
<p>Yellow, who slept anywhere, being a tramp dog by
nature, had elected to pass the night outside Scott&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
window, and the cabin in which Scott was sleeping was
across the street and only a few feet away from the
window from which Pachuca was trying to escape.
Not content with barking, the interfering Yellow
started on a gallop for the peculiar looking person
hanging out of the window. Almost instantly, a light
flashed in Scott&#8217;s room and a head was thrust out of
the window.</p>
<p>With an exasperated groan Pachuca drew himself
back again and waited. Scott&#8217;s head was withdrawn,
and two seconds later, Scott, himself, clad in pajamas
and a bathrobe, dashed out of the cabin and was met
by another figure which seemed to spring from nowhere.
Pachuca thought the second figure looked like
Miller, the man who had brought his blankets, but he
was not sure. By this time the dog had stopped barking
and was following the two men. Pachuca stood in
the window, waiting developments. Scott looked up
with evident relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re there, are you?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it appears,&#8221; disgustedly. &#8220;Am I a cat to
scramble out of a window?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Yellow was barking at something,&#8221; replied
Scott, with a grin. &#8220;Might have been a plain, four-footed
one, and it might have been a human puss. If
you don&#8217;t mind, I reckon I&#8217;ll tie him to the front door
down here. He&#8217;s rough on cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suit yourself, <i>amigo</i>, I&#8217;m going to sleep,&#8221; was the
disdainful reply.</p>
<p>Well, that ended going out by the window. Pachuca,
having a Latin dislike for fresh air in the sleeping-room,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
closed the window angrily and threw himself
down on the mattress. It was hard and there was no
pillow. The blankets he would need to keep him
warm. Pachuca, though used to hardships, dearly
loved his comfort. He glanced around the room
again; an old office coat hanging on a peg in a corner
caught his eye. It would do for a pillow. He took it
down and rolled it into a wad. As he did so, a clinking
sound became audible. He reached into the pocket&mdash;a
bunch of keys and an old hunting-knife came to
light.</p>
<p>Pachuca grinned. Well, Heaven was looking out
for its own; it was not in the nature of things that a
Pachuca should be trampled in the dust by the proletariat!
Patiently, one after another, he tried the keys&mdash;ah,
the right one at last! He turned it and the door
opened. Pachuca chuckled delightedly; it pleased his
whimsicality to think that so apparently unsurmountable
a difficulty should be solved in so plain and unromantic
a fashion.</p>
<p>He returned to the window and saw Scott and Miller
standing outside Scott&#8217;s cabin; saw Scott go inside and
the cabin become dark once more and Miller go on
down the street, stopping at the last house near the
corral. Pachuca frowned. Was the fellow going in
and going to bed like a Christian, or was he going to
hang around and keep an eye on the car? This last
would be extremely awkward. Miller, however,
turned in at the house and disappeared.</p>
<p>Pachuca spent five minutes at the window watching,
but he did not reappear. &#8220;Ah well, one must risk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
something!&#8221; he mused, and glanced down at the sleeping
Yellow. Cautiously and with the soft step of one
who has learned the wisdom of a silent tread, the
young man slid down the stairway. The door at the
foot of the stairs was open; it opened outward and
they had tied the dog back of it.</p>
<p>Juan Pachuca opened the hunting-knife and surveyed
it in a business-like fashion. There was a sudden
movement of his arm and poor Yellow shivered
and crumpled up noiselessly. Quietly, the knife still
in his hand, Pachuca slipped behind the building and
continued his way toward the corral. He reached the
car unhindered and breathed a sigh of relief; the rest
would be plain sailing. A peep into the tonneau
showed him that the plunder had been removed; but
that, of course, he had expected. He jumped into the
car and started the engine. At the same moment, a
burly figure rushed out of the house near by, caught at
the car as it started, clung to the running-board and,
leaning over, seized Pachuca by the arm.</p>
<p>It was Miller; Miller, who had indeed gone to bed,
but whose bed was near the window of the little cabin,
and who had been keeping one eye on the car and had
emerged, scantily attired in a nightshirt tucked into a
pair of trousers, to put a spoke in the Mexican&#8217;s wheel.
Pachuca set his teeth! It was too much&mdash;to be so near
liberty and then to lose it. A desperate look came into
his eyes; he paid no attention to the angry demand of
his assailant that he stop the car, but, making a sudden
lunge, he drove the hunting-knife into the shoulder of
the big man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you, put up that knife!&#8221; choked Miller, seeing
the blow coming but not quickly enough to dodge
it. With one hand clutching the car and one holding
Pachuca, he was too late to reach his gun. By the
time he loosed his hold on the Mexican, the knife had
reached its mark; a knife none too sharp, but driven
by a practiced hand, it pierced the flesh, and with a
groan, Miller dropped off the running-board into the
road.</p>
<p>Ah, the good car! Pachuca sang with joy as it
leaped ahead into the darkness. They would be awake
in a moment, the lazy Gringos, but what of it? He
would be out of their reach. He laughed as he flew
past the house where Polly slept.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adieu, pretty American! I kiss your hand&mdash;until
we meet again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Something struck the back of the car with a sharp,
tearing sound. Pachuca turned with a grin. A light
had sprung up in the house into which he had seen
Scott go. With another chuckle, the young Mexican
bent over the wheel and whirled down the road toward
freedom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>

<p>Marc Scott was slow in falling asleep on the night
of Pachuca&#8217;s escape. He was in the habit of rolling
over a few times and losing himself; but on this particular
night he was tormented by half a dozen ugly
little worries. He was worried about Adams, whose
leg had a nasty look to the unprofessional eye; he was
worried about Pachuca, whose case was going to require
a good deal of finesse; and he was worried about
Polly Street, who had to be conveyed to the border,
revolution or no revolution.</p>
<p>The most pressing danger on his horizon, Scott did
not worry about because he did not recognize it. He
was like one of those patients in whose system a deadly
disease has started, but who remains in perfect health
to all outward appearances. He was in happy ignorance
of his feelings for Polly Street. He had been in
love times enough, he would have told you, to know
the symptoms; all of which was quite true, but the fact
remained that this time he did not know them.</p>
<p>Polly Street was so exactly the sort of girl that Marc
Scott had not the faintest idea of falling in love with,
much less marrying, that he would have dismissed the
possibility with a shrug. He, who valued his freedom
above everything, to throw it away for exactly the kind
of woman who would take the greatest pleasure in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
trampling on it? As for his jealousy of Juan Pachuca,
which should have opened his eyes, he put it aside
easily. He didn&#8217;t like the fellow&mdash;never had&mdash;and it
annoyed him to see a decent girl allowing herself to be
humbugged by his good looks and oily tongue.</p>
<p>It was a pity, for she was a plucky young thing. She
had done well to bring back the prisoner and his car;
mighty few girls would have had the courage to try it.
It was foolish, of course, a regular kid trick&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
have succeeded once in a dozen times, but nevertheless,
she had shown pluck. It was at this stage in his reflections
that he had been disturbed by Yellow&#8217;s barking
and had gone out to investigate. The air and the
action had changed his circulation and his thought and
when he went to bed the second time he dropped off
easily.</p>
<p>This time he was aroused by the noise of the engine
started by Pachuca on his escape. At first he hardly
realized what it was that had wakened him, but as it
dawned on his consciousness, he jumped to his feet and
rushed to the window in time to see the car tear down
the road. With a muttered exclamation, Scott seized
his gun and sent a bullet wildly in the direction of the
escaping prisoner. Then he drew on his trousers, calling
to Hard at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Another raid?&#8221; growled the
sleepy Bostonian, who had dozed peacefully through
Pachuca&#8217;s first attempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. The guy&#8217;s got away,&#8221; snapped Scott, angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we didn&#8217;t particularly need him, did we?&#8221;
observed Hard, sitting up reluctantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We needed his car and needed it bad,&#8221; said Scott,
viciously. He tramped out of the room, while Hard
reached drowsily for his clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, he must have made it through the window!&#8221;
he muttered as he crossed the street, then as
he came upon the body of the dog, thrown aside behind
the open door, &#8220;The dirty butcher!&#8221; he growled,
furiously. &#8220;And I didn&#8217;t have sense enough to search
him for a knife!&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside, he met O&#8217;Grady and Johnson, sketchily
dressed and wrathful.</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard him, too, did you?&#8221; he growled. &#8220;He
got out by the window. This is some of his work,&#8221; he
continued, pointing to Yellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not,&#8221; said O&#8217;Grady, promptly. &#8220;Did you
ever hear of a guy jumping out of a second-story winder
and shutting it after him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;it&#8217;s shut,&#8221; grinned Johnson. &#8220;He come out
of the door all right. It&#8217;s wide open, and not hurt,
either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who let him out? Where&#8217;s the key? You had
it, O&#8217;Grady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not&mdash;you handed it to the girl, yourself. She
locked him in all right; I heard her do it,&#8221; replied
O&#8217;Grady quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That explains it,&#8221; said Scott, shortly. &#8220;She came
over here and let him out. Might have expected it, I
suppose, with a flighty youngster and a smooth talker
like Pachuca.&#8221; He turned away in the direction of the
house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mad!&#8221; murmured Johnson, admiringly. He
liked a little excitement himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mad? He&#8217;s jealous, the fool!&#8221; Matt offered, disgustedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealous? Who of? The greaser?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Good-looking, Juan is, and a winner with
the dames.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott&#8217;s one of them woman haters. What d&#8217;ye
mean&mdash;jealous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman haters?&#8221; Matt spat disdainfully. &#8220;There
ain&#8217;t no such thing as a woman hater, Tommy, in the
whole animal kingdom. Don&#8217;t you fall for none of
that stuff. But, believe me, that girl never opened that
door. She&#8217;s a straight, honest, smart girl, if she is
flighty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if she didn&#8217;t, who did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I ain&#8217;t sleuthed around enough yet
to find out. Hullo, here&#8217;s Boston&mdash;half asleep, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott was angry clear through. He did not stop to
analyze his emotions&mdash;he was not of an analytical mind&mdash;and
he did not care why he was angry. He felt that
Polly Street, a girl of whom he was beginning to think
rather highly, had done an unsportsmanlike thing; a
thing that Bob&#8217;s sister ought to have been ashamed to
do; had disgraced the family, so to speak, and had seriously
inconvenienced him into the bargain.</p>
<p>Scott had depended on that automobile for various
things. He wanted it to fetch a doctor for Jimmy, and
to take Polly, herself, to the border in comfort. Both
these important things she had jeopardized because she
had been coaxed into it by a soft-spoken young man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
with dark eyes. The treasure story he put aside.
Even a girl from the East would hardly have taken
that stuff seriously, he thought.</p>
<p>He would have felt just the same, he reasoned, had
the culprit been Bob instead of Bob&#8217;s sister. There
was, thank Heaven, nothing soft about him! He could
see and hear and even enjoy a good-looking girl without
making a fool of himself. That was the beauty of
being on the way to forty&mdash;one saw things in their
right light&mdash;and did not make a fool of one&#8217;s self over
girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marc Scott, are we being raided again or what?
Did I hear a shot and a machine going by or was I
dreaming?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Van, who, clad in a blanket
kimono, her feet thrust into moccasins, and a gay-looking
pink boudoir cap on her head, came to the door
before Scott reached it. In her rear could be dimly
seen another figure, wrapped in a gray blanket.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to know,&#8221; said Scott, rudely; focussing
his attention on the pink cap and ignoring the blanketed
figure in the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean&mdash;I ought to know?&#8221; indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody has unlocked the office door and let that
half-breed get away and he&#8217;s taken his car with him,&#8221;
said Scott. &#8220;The key&#8217;s in your house&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s in this house. It&#8217;s in the pocket of
my sweater,&#8221; answered Polly, indignantly. &#8220;If you
think I let him out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She was too angry to continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he didn&#8217;t get out by the window because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
it&#8217;s shut, and there&#8217;s no chimney for him to melt out
of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Marc Scott, ain&#8217;t you ashamed of yourself?
Coming here and talking to ladies like that&mdash;and
in the middle of the night, too.&#8221; Mrs. Van Zandt
was as angry as the other two. &#8220;That key couldn&#8217;t
get out of this house to-night without my knowing it.
He&#8217;s brainy enough to get out without help, that fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may be brainy, but he&#8217;s hardly brilliant enough
to go through a locked door,&#8221; said Scott, obstinately.
&#8220;Somebody let him out, that&#8217;s all. If you&#8217;ll be kind
enough to look for the key, Miss Street, and see if it&#8217;s
been taken away&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could it be? From my room?&#8221; demanded
Polly, angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to hold an inquest over it?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Van, cuttingly. &#8220;I see the jury coming
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson, O&#8217;Grady and Hard were coming across the
street. Polly drew her blanket closely around her and
tucked one bare foot behind the other. Her reddish
colored braids gave her a squaw-like appearance in the
darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Scotty, don&#8217;t stir up the community,&#8221;
called Hard, cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m the guilty party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It never dawned on me till I saw the unlocked
door,&#8221; confessed Hard, with a chuckle. &#8220;The chap
must have found that old bunch of keys that&#8217;s been
knocking around in the pocket of my old office coat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s where he got the knife that did for
poor Yellow, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean there was a duplicate key?&#8221; demanded
Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must have been. Clever chap to ferret it
out,&#8221; replied Hard, breezily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty clever. I could open a door myself with
a key in my hand,&#8221; muttered Scott, as he turned away.
&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s gone and the car&#8217;s gone and we might as
well go back to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just one moment.&#8221; Polly&#8217;s voice was clear and
firm. &#8220;I think you owe me an apology, Mr. Scott.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a suppressed chuckle from the rear where
the train gang still lingered. Scott stiffened and
cleared his throat consciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize,&#8221; he said; then, as he saw the others
disappear down the street, &#8220;Will you shake hands?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not right now; I&#8217;m going to think it over,&#8221; said the
girl, coolly. &#8220;I think you should have known that I
wouldn&#8217;t do a thing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I did know it, of course,&#8221; confessed Scott,
helplessly. &#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t believe it.&#8221; Polly&#8217;s voice was cutting.
&#8220;Well, next time have a little more faith in your
friends, Mr. Scott,&#8221; and the blanketed figure disappeared
into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had you there,&#8221; observed Mrs. Van. &#8220;Well,
go home to bed before you wake up Jimmy&mdash;it&#8217;s a
wonder he&#8217;s slept through this all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went into the house and knocked softly at the
girl&#8217;s door&mdash;after listening a moment and assuring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
herself that Adams had not wakened. Polly&#8217;s room
was dark and she was standing, still wrapped in the
blanket, by the window in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, rather curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Mrs. Van&#8217;s usually glib
tongue faltered. &#8220;I was just going to say that you
mustn&#8217;t take Marc Scott too&mdash;too&mdash;I mean, you
mustn&#8217;t be too hard on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s just his way; he don&#8217;t mean to be ugly.
He&#8217;s queer, Scotty is, kind of&mdash;oh, I don&#8217;t know
how to put it, but he didn&#8217;t mean to be rude to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was, though, very rude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I mean. It sort of shocked him
to think you&#8217;d do a thing like that and he didn&#8217;t stop
to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;ll stop to think next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, but I don&#8217;t reckon so. Folks like that you
can&#8217;t change much; you have to take &#8217;em or leave &#8217;em
as they are. He&#8217;s awful square, though. I&#8217;d trust him
with anything; money, liquor, or women. When
you&#8217;ve been around as much as I have, you&#8217;ll know
that means something.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Scott, Hard, and the train gang,
going down to the corral to investigate, found Miller
lying as Pachuca had left him, in the middle of the
road. He was regaining consciousness as they came
along, and did not seem to be badly hurt, the knife
having entered the fleshy part of the arm near the
shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Serves me damn right, bein&#8217; so slow with my gun,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I suppose the guy got away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he got away!&#8221; muttered Scott, as they
helped Miller to bed. &#8220;That&#8217;s the kind of luck we&#8217;re
playing in just now around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Breakfast next morning was not a particularly
cheerful meal. Adams was still in bed, and Williams
was feverish and cross. Miller seemed little the worse
for his accident, but he was blue; he had been particularly
attached to the dog and felt its death more
than his own misadventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blankets, canned goods, saddles&mdash;everything they
could grab,&#8221; muttered Williams, resentfully. &#8220;Nice
condition to be in with a revolution looming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not looming, loomed,&#8221; said O&#8217;Grady, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I could get hold of an <i>Omaha Bee</i>,&#8221; murmured
Johnson. &#8220;I never somehow feel like I had a
grip on a situation till I&#8217;ve seen my home paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll ride over to Casa Grande this morning
and get the doctor,&#8221; said Hard. &#8220;That leg of Jimmy&#8217;s
needs advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221; Scott looked at Polly. &#8220;Want
to go?&#8221; he said; then as she hesitated, he looked at
her penitently, smiling as Scott did not often smile,
and whispered: &#8220;Please do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How mean of him! He knows I&#8217;m dying to.
How&#8217;s anybody going to stay mad when they want
to do things?&#8221; said the girl to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too far for her,&#8221; objected Mrs. Van.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll send the Chink back,&#8221; said Scott, persuasively,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
&#8220;and we&#8217;ll stay all night with Herrick. We&#8217;ll
make him play for you,&#8221; he added, as Polly smiled in
spite of herself. &#8220;Will you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must,&#8221; said Hard. &#8220;It&#8217;s her last chance to see
the country.&#8221; And so the matter was settled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Chink&#8217;ll ride the whole twenty miles on a
dead run&mdash;he&#8217;ll be here to dinner,&#8221; said Matt. &#8220;Ever
see a Chinaman ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll ride his own horse, then,&#8221; replied Scott, as
he left the room. &#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;ll bring Herrick back
with us, Mrs. Van.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t leave that piano of his,&#8221; prophesied Mrs.
Van Zandt. &#8220;No more than a mother&#8217;d leave her
baby when there was danger around.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was ten o&#8217;clock when the three riders started on
their trip, Scott preserving a reasonably cheerful face,
in spite of the fact that he hated late starts. It was a
beautiful morning; the sky, blue and cloudless, the air
fresh and invigorating with the crispness of early
spring, the radiant clearness of the atmosphere making
neighbors of the mountains, all combined to make
a tonic which showed signs of going to Polly&#8217;s head.
After all, there are few sensations like the starting out
upon a horseback trip; the mare&#8217;s springy trot, the
freshness of her own healthy body, even the feel of
the bridle reins brought her joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look mighty happy,&#8221; commented Hard. &#8220;It
must be pleasant to be twenty-three.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly laughed. &#8220;It is,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
going to be just as happy at forty-three. I&#8217;ve found
the recipe.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you sell it to me? My next one happens to
be my forty-second. I&#8217;ll be needing it soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you a present of it. Stay out-of-doors and
keep on doing things. Of course, I haven&#8217;t tried it for
forty-three years, but I feel in my bones that it will
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never could see, myself, how people could spend
twenty-two out of their twenty-four hours under a
roof, the way most of them do,&#8221; said Scott, thoughtfully.
&#8220;Here, we turn now into the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where Pachuca&#8217;s men went yesterday,&#8221; said
Polly. &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t meet them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No danger of that. Those fly-by-nights are a long
way from here by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They told me yesterday in Conejo that Obregon
had been put under arrest in Mexico City. If that&#8217;s
true it may put a cog in the revolutionary machinery,&#8221;
said Hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we&#8217;d managed to keep our hands on that
automobile,&#8221; remarked Scott, wistfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
half fancy trying to make the border in a wagon, and
no one knows how the railroads will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trail debouched from the road, running over
ground very slightly elevated. There was for some
distance no particular reason as far as Polly could see
for its being a trail at all except that it hadn&#8217;t been
sufficiently traveled to make it a road. It was merely
a narrow little path leading over some very barren-looking
country, but leading ever upward, gradually
but surely, toward the hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, the regular road runs fairly straight along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
toward Conejo for maybe twenty miles, and then
meets a crossroad which runs past Casa Grande,&#8221; explained
Scott. &#8220;Now, with this trail, we cut directly
across those foothills, over a couple of ranges of mountains,
across a big mesa and down. Casa Grande is
almost in a straight line from here and we cut off a
lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Casa Grande is an awfully fancy sort of name.
Is it a wonderful place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a good little ranch. These Latins like big
sounding names,&#8221; replied Scott. &#8220;Casa Grande is
very common down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dip in the trail took them into an arroyo and out
the other side, where they lost sight entirely of Athens.
A few moments later, they wound their way through
some brush into a narrow canyon, walled on one side
by hills and with a drop of some fifteen feet on the
other side into a ravine. Out of the ravine grew more
brush so densely that it almost crowded the little trail
out of existence.</p>
<p>Here it was necessary to go single file and Polly
noticed how naturally Scott took the lead, leaving her
to follow and Hard to bring up the rear. She noted
with some amusement that it seemed characteristic of
him to take the lead everywhere, just as it seemed
quite in keeping with Hard&#8217;s easy-going nature to fall
into the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet of the two Mr. Hard has the education
and the brains,&#8221; thought the girl. &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not
fair. I believe you can have just as good a brain without
education&mdash;only you&#8217;re hampered in the use of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
Marc Scott has what the psychologists call &#8216;initiative.&#8217;
Oh, look!&#8221;</p>
<p>High up in the air a bird had flown out from among
the tree-tops on the other side of the canyon&mdash;a big
bird with wide spreading wings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an eagle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An eagle!&#8221; Polly was awed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a nest up there somewhere,&#8221; said Scott,
shading his eyes with his hand and peering upward.
&#8220;Last year I was riding over this trail with Gomez,
an Indian we had working for us. We were just about
here when an eagle, a young one, flew out from the
trees. Before I could speak, Gomez up with his gun
and shot it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to kill the geezer&mdash;but Lord, what can
you expect of an Indian?&#8221;</p>
<p>As they proceeded, Polly found herself riding closer
to Scott, while Hard lagged behind. She was not displeased.
Scott on horseback and in the woods was
Scott at his best as she was beginning to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering,&#8221; she said, as the mare pushed her
nose along the big bay&#8217;s flank, &#8220;how you know so
much about the country. You aren&#8217;t a Westerner, are
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? No, indeed. Born in New York State and
raised in Michigan. Never laid eyes on anything west
of the Mississippi until I came out to Colorado to work
in the mines. Then I drifted into New Mexico and
down here.&#8221; Scott was riding with his knee around
the pommel and talking meditatively over his shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve got mining in my blood. My grandfather
was a Forty-Niner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he get rich?&#8221; asked Polly, interestedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so&#8217;s you&#8217;d notice it. Spent all he had and
died trying to get home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard luck, wasn&#8217;t it? My folks went to Detroit
when I was a little codger and they both died there.
I was adopted by an uncle&mdash;an uncle who was the
whitest man God ever made,&#8221; declared Scott, solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why was he&mdash;I mean, how was he?&#8221; Polly had
by nature that healthy capacity for asking questions,
which is one of the most flattering characteristics that
a woman can have or assume.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was always doing decent things. Didn&#8217;t have
much money, either, but somehow he always made it
do for a lot of folks who didn&#8217;t have any. He adopted
a girl that wasn&#8217;t any kin to him, had her educated and
then married her. She made him a fine wife, too,
thought the world of him. Well, he adopted me and
sent me to school and when he saw I had the roving
instinct and couldn&#8217;t stick to the books, he gave me a
lift to go West to the mines. He knew that there was
no use arguing.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was queer, too. Didn&#8217;t like city folks nor their
ways. He owned one of those big farms out near
what&#8217;s now Grosse Pointe&mdash;ran down to the river&mdash;and
when the town began to grow out toward them,
instead of holding on to his land as it began to get
valuable, he&#8217;d sell out and go further away. Died,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
leaving Aunt Mary just enough to live comfortably on&mdash;might
have been a millionaire. But Uncle Silas was
a wise man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes when I look at these tight-fisted old
guys who make their millions and tie &#8217;em up into
estates to hand down, and then remember Uncle Silas&mdash;not
giving a hoot for money and always pulling
along a dozen or two poor relations and setting &#8217;em
on their feet, living comfortable and happy, leaving a
wife that&#8217;s as fond of him to-day as she was the day
he died&mdash;well, I sort of wonder if money and success
mean as much as folks think they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott&#8217;s autobiography was halted by the view which
met their eyes as they rounded the turn at the top of
the canyon. Turning, the narrow trail wound its way
around the mountainside until one looked down upon
the tops of foothills, green with scrubby vegetation.
Then it stretched in an irregular line down the mountainside,
to disappear in their midst. Beyond lay another
range of mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back of that range and across the mesa is where
Herrick&#8217;s place is,&#8221; said Scott, as they drew rein and
waited for Hard to come along. Polly gazed in silence.
It was the first view she had had of the wilder
part of the country and it thrilled her.</p>
<p>Hard came up with them. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d
better make a little speed when we hit the level?&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only crossed one stream since we started,&#8221;
observed Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cross another just before we get to Herrick&#8217;s,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
said Hard, &#8220;but it never has much water in it except
in the rainy season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen plenty in it then,&#8221; said Scott, laughing.
&#8220;I was caught on the wrong side once when they&#8217;d
had a cloudburst in the mountains. Oh boy, you
should have seen her come down! Swept away a
wagon with two horses and the Mexican who was
driving it in just two minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how could it&mdash;in two minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it could and did. Before that there wasn&#8217;t
a foot of water in the river bed. When the water
came thundering down there was eight or ten. Picked
up trees, bushes, chicken coops, greasers&mdash;anything in
its way, and whirled &#8217;em down the canyon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the middle of the afternoon when they crossed
the second range, which they did by means of a trail
which went through a gap, thus cutting off the worst
of the ascent. Once through the gap, they came out
upon a huge mesa from which they looked down upon
the valley in which Casa Grande was located. On the
mesa, the tired horses broke into the little easy-going
jog which mountain ponies love.</p>
<p>Scott watched Polly&#8217;s sparkling eyes with real gratification.
He had chosen to go by trail rather than by
road very largely that she might have this experience.
He wanted her to see more of the country before she
went back to the city and its ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a natural out-of-doors woman, and she&#8217;s
never had the chance to find it out,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;Better
than a golf course?&#8221; he asked, as they trotted
across the broad mesa.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, reproachfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the
happy hunting grounds! I never understood before
why the Indians called their Heaven that. It was because
they were thinking of space and openness and
freedom. I think it beats our kind of Heaven all
hollow,&#8221; finished the cheerful product of 1920.</p>
<p>Finally they came out on the other side of the little
river bed, which lay below the mesa and was entered
by means of a rocky staircase, crossed a round-topped
hill, and there, in a flat little valley surrounded by hills,
the rear view of the Casa Grande ranch-house became
visible. Two or three smaller buildings stood near it
and a fence marked the corral.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>CASA GRANDE</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a great stillness about the place; the
whole panorama suggested a picture rather than an
actuality, except for the white clouds sailing slowly
about in the blue sky, and an occasional bird flying
from one tree or bush to another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like things being so still,&#8221; said Scott.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s push on.&#8221; Riding around to the front of the
house&mdash;a long, narrow, adobe building, they came upon
the first real sign of habitation; a brown hen, who, accompanied
by her family, was scratching around the
walk with an immense show of industry; while on the
veranda sat two men. One was a white man; the
other, a Chinese, dressed in the dark blue shirt and
trousers of his people. As the newcomers dismounted,
the white man came forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph, it&#8217;s you!&#8221; he remarked, with evident relief.
&#8220;Well, here is what is left of a once prosperous
household.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was a little man, thin and wiry, with bushy brown
hair and beard, and keen dark eyes. His hands, slender
and with long white fingers, played nervously
with a quirt which he held, apparently for no purpose
than that those nervous members might have occupation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; demanded Scott. &#8220;How do,
Li Yow?&#8221; as the Chinaman came forward smilingly
to take the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;All gone,&#8221; he said, blandly. &#8220;Laided. One hen,
some shickens&mdash;notting else left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raided! Did that young rascal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Hard,
when Herrick interrupted impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he has been to you, too? He makes a clean
sweep of it! He comes here at noon with a score,
perhaps, of men; and if there is anything they do not
take, it is because it is broken&mdash;like my wagon. Men,
money, and stock&mdash;our neighbor is thorough and no
mistake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid of it,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;He&#8217;s cleaning
up the community. Herrick, I want you to know Bob
Street&#8217;s sister, Miss Polly Street.&#8221; He added a few
words of explanation of the girl&#8217;s presence. Herrick
surveyed her with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are unlucky to strike this country at such a
time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Unless you like experiences?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Polly, promptly. &#8220;That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re
sending me home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man smiled. &#8220;After all, most experience
is worth while,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sit down and rest&mdash;you
will stay, all of you, won&#8217;t you? For the night?
There is some food left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott and Li Yow walked away with the horses to
the barn which stood not a great way from the house,
surrounded by a good-sized corral. Polly sank into
an easy chair which commanded through a window a
view of a part of the living-room. She caught a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
glimpse of a grand piano, bright colored rugs, bookcases
overflowing with books, and other evidences of
comfort. Hard gave their host an account of the
Athens hold-up, not forgetting the part Polly had
played in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remembered,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that Li was a doctor,
and thought perhaps you&#8217;d loan him to us for Jimmy.
We don&#8217;t think much of the Conejo medico.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Himmel, no!&#8221; responded Herrick, quickly. &#8220;You
shall have Li, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly leaned back with a little sigh of content.
Herrick smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are tired,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and by and by you will
be chilly. Henry, as Li is busy, suppose you build up
a fire in the living-room?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly looked a bit surprised, but Hard laughed as he
went into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Herrick never does any rough work,&#8221; he said, indulgently.
&#8220;He has to take care of his hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; replied their host, &#8220;my fingers are my good
friends, consequently I take good care of them. Why
not? Some day I may need their services again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Polly, frankly. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s
rather dreadful for an artist to bury himself in a place
like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One does not bury oneself, my child, one rests and
creates,&#8221; said the musician, gently. &#8220;Ah, here is
Scott! He has been looking at my wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott tossed Polly her long cloak which she had left
on her saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I took a look at the wagon, while Li turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
the horses out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think I can patch it up
so that we can drive to Athens in it. You see, Herrick,
we&#8217;ve only got three horses and I have to send
Li back on one of them to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can he make it&mdash;the horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a little rest and a feed&mdash;if Li takes it easy.
Of course, it&#8217;s not the way I like to treat my horses,
but Jimmy&#8217;s leg is in a bad state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. You may have Li and also the wagon,&#8221;
replied Herrick. &#8220;The more willingly because I have
a favor to ask of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a guest,&#8221; said the other, slowly. &#8220;A lady,
from the South. She has had to leave her plantation
and is on her way back to the United States. I had
intended taking her to the border, but since you are
sending this young lady&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stopped, and Polly
thought she saw a look of understanding pass between
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see her through, of course,&#8221; said Scott, readily.
&#8220;Can she be ready to go in the morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think so,&#8221; replied the little man; &#8220;we will
ask her.&#8221; To Polly&#8217;s disappointment, the talk passed
on to the revolution and other political subjects, and
nothing more was said about the mysterious guest.
&#8220;If they&#8217;re going to tack a Mexican refugee to me,
they might at least tell me something about her!&#8221; she
thought.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Hard had entered the living-room
and was examining the contents of the wood-box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Empty, of course!&#8221; he said, with a smile. &#8220;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
household is quite evidently off its balance.&#8221; He went
out through the kitchen and returned in a few minutes
with a basket of logs from the wood-pile. As he re-entered
the living-room, a woman&mdash;a tall, slender,
graceful woman, with black hair and eyes, entered it
from the hall. There was a moment&#8217;s silence and
then the basket of wood dropped crashingly from
Hard&#8217;s arms. The woman smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry!&#8221; she exclaimed, coming forward, both
hands outstretched. &#8220;Henry! I heard your voice&mdash;I&#8217;d
have known it anywhere, even if Victor hadn&#8217;t told
me that you lived near here. You haven&#8217;t changed
one bit in&mdash;how many years is it since I saw you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteen years, six months, and twenty-seven days,
Clara,&#8221; replied the tall Bostonian, taking her hands and
leading her to the light. Something in her easy,
friendly manner had softened both the shock of the
surprise and the embarrassment of the situation. He
looked long into her face and then dropped her hands.
She sank into a chair by the fireplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a long time, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one would think so to look at you,&#8221; said Hard,
sincerely. &#8220;You are the same Clara Mallory who
went to Paris fifteen years ago to study music.&#8221; He
picked up the basket of wood and proceeded to build
the fire. She watched him, her eyes misty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s odd that I haven&#8217;t changed for I&#8217;ve been
through a lot,&#8221; she said, with a little smile. &#8220;And
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same easy-going, good-for-nothing chap, I
reckon,&#8221; replied Hard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But this mining business? But, of course, you
were educated for it at the Tech&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, without much idea of using it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, being a Hard, you weren&#8217;t contented with doing
nothing,&#8221; said Mrs. Conrad. &#8220;You know why I&#8217;m
here, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Herrick told me some time ago that you
were living down near Mexico City&mdash;and that Dick
Conrad had died, and how.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Conrad was silent for a moment. &#8220;Two years
ago,&#8221; she said, quietly. &#8220;While he lived, we managed
to hold down the plantation fairly well. He got on
well with the government, and he organized the peons
and fought off the bandits. Since then, things have
gone rather badly; it takes a man to handle that kind
of a situation. I&#8217;ve been raided six times in two years
and my patience is almost gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote up here to Victor; he&#8217;s always been a
good friend of mine&mdash;I studied with him in London,
you know, and knew his wife well. He advised me to
sell and go home. I didn&#8217;t take his advice about selling;
I couldn&#8217;t get anything decent for the place right
now, and I&#8217;ve a fairly good man running it for me.
I have faith in this country and I intend to come back
some day and go on with my plantation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You always were plucky, Clara.&#8221; Hard touched
a match to his fire. &#8220;But Mexico&#8217;s no place for you.
Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; admitted Clara, frankly. &#8220;Back to
the States, of course, but where and for what I don&#8217;t
know. But I hope&mdash;my music.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your music?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Victor says it&#8217;s not too late&mdash;but&mdash;well, perhaps.
I&#8217;m out of the way of cities, and I&#8217;ve enough so that
I don&#8217;t have to do anything, but&mdash;oh, I would love to
be at it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard smiled. &#8220;You will, Clara. You&#8217;re not an
idler&mdash;as I am. You&#8217;ll be in the thick of it in no
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you have found one another! I thought perhaps
you would.&#8221; Herrick&#8217;s voice broke in upon their
talk. He was followed by Polly and Scott, and introductions
and explanations came naturally.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a Mexican refugee, and it is the lady of the
photograph!&#8221; Polly said to herself, triumphantly.
&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t look to me much like a love affair.
They&#8217;ve got over it evidently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you also were raided by Juan Pachuca?&#8221; said
Mrs. Conrad, as Scott seated himself beside her. The
latter nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I happened to hear him talking to one of my men,&#8221;
said Herrick, &#8220;and telling him that he had a rendezvous
with Angel Gonzales, somewhere in the vicinity&mdash;not
too near, I hope. I don&#8217;t want Angel Gonzales
on my place; I&#8217;d rather entertain the devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a queer name&mdash;Angel! Who is he?&#8221; asked
Polly, curiously. She was beginning to realize, since
she had gotten off her horse and relaxed into the comfort
of an easy chair near the fire, how very tired she
was.</p>
<p>&#8220;A young ruffian with a price on his head,&#8221; replied
Herrick. &#8220;He&#8217;s half Indian and half Mexican
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
and they tell me that both halves are very bad indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Gonzales&mdash;by the way, Miss Polly, don&#8217;t mix
him up with Pablo Gonzales who is a general of note
and one of the candidates for the next presidency&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said
Hard, laughing. &#8220;If Gonzales is
trying to get in with the new party, he must have inside
information that the revolution is going to be a success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, its first work had better be to line Angel
and a few more of his kind up against a wall and settle
&#8217;em with a firing squad,&#8221; said Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think,&#8221; declared Mrs. Conrad. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t put much faith in this regiment business. I
think Pachuca has simply gone back to first principles
and run amuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Polly stopped, consciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Polly thinks he&#8217;s a gentleman and that ends
it,&#8221; said Scott, drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s young, and the wretch has a way with him.
I liked him myself when I was young and frivolous,&#8221;
said Mrs. Conrad, cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve entertained him
many a time in Mexico City. Suppose you go into
my room, my dear, and have a nice rest and clean up
while I go and help Li rustle us a dinner out of the
remnants?&#8221; she continued, taking the girl by the
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Angel Gonzales is playing around this neighborhood,
the sooner we get away the better,&#8221; said Scott to
Hard as the three men were left together. &#8220;Come
and cast your weather eye over the wagon. For a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
quiet part of the country, we seem to have struck a bad
gait.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearly eight o&#8217;clock when they sat down to
their dinner; a dinner contrived with Oriental thrift
from materials scorned by the marauders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give a Chinaman a handful of rice and a few vegetables
and he&#8217;ll make you a feast, so my husband used
to say,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Conrad. &#8220;You simply can&#8217;t
starve them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Li wants to start right after dinner,&#8221; said Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;And ride all night?&#8221; asked Herrick.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says so. He says he knows the trail, and, of
course, he&#8217;s got the moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little later, as they sat around the fire, they heard
the sound of his horse&#8217;s feet on the stones and knew
that the Chinaman had started.</p>
<p>Polly began to feel the charm of the quaint room,
with its dim lighting, the low fire, the fantastic patterns
of rug and basket showing faintly, and through the
windows the mountains and the stars. As the conversation
began to yield to the quiet of the place, Herrick
went to the piano and played softly. It had never
fallen to the lot of the girl to hear such music; the
revelation of a man&#8217;s soul, poured out through an absolute
mastery of the art. The little man, with the
brown beard and the long nervous hands, sat hunched
up in his low chair, knees crossed, eyes half closed,
drawing from the keyboard the chords which carried to
each one the message of his own heart.</p>
<p>Presently, Clara Conrad rose, and, standing back of
the piano, leaning over it, her hands clasped, began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
sing&mdash;softly and easily&mdash;her voice, a rich contralto,
blending with Herrick&#8217;s small but exquisite baritone,
in an old song. Polly looked at Hard, seated in a dim
corner, his chin resting on his hand, his eyes fixed on
the two at the piano. She wondered what he was
thinking and what the woman meant to him. There
was something almost too intimate about the whole
scene and she was glad when Scott rose and went
toward the door, speaking to her as he passed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to see a pretty sight?&#8221; he said. She nodded
and followed him out. For miles in front of them
stretched the hilly country, dotted here and there in
the half light by clumps of trees and bushes showing
inky black in the night, while in the distance stretched
the mountains, irregular, dark, and mysterious looking.
Over all shone the moon, while the stars&mdash;but
who can describe the stars in a desert country?</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes you feel like you&#8217;d never seen stars before,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Scott, as the girl stood, drinking in
the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it? So many, so bright and so twinkly!
Do you know, I don&#8217;t wonder that Mrs. Conrad&#8217;s
rather a wonderful woman&mdash;living all the time with
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she is, rather. She&#8217;s had a hard life, too;
lots of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t her husband&mdash;I mean, weren&#8217;t they happy
together?&#8221; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I guess they were,&#8221; replied Scott,
cautiously. &#8220;I reckon they were like most married
folks, rubbed along together pretty well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you said she&#8217;d had lots of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott smiled. &#8220;And you made up your mind right
off that it was a love affair, eh? You&#8217;re a good deal
of a kid, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly flushed. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re rather inconsiderate,&#8221;
she said, crossly. &#8220;You start up my curiosity
and then you make fun of me. I don&#8217;t think I like
the way you treat me, most of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair, myself,&#8221; said Scott, penitently.
&#8220;I suppose a girl brought up as you&#8217;ve been
oughtn&#8217;t to be blamed for seeing a love affair behind
every bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say brought up as I&#8217;ve been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean having everything easy; everything done
for you. No real hard knocks in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, if that&#8217;s all, I&#8217;ll probably have hard
knocks enough before I get through. Most people do,
I&#8217;ve noticed,&#8221; replied Polly, easily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll probably
marry somebody who&#8217;ll spend all his money and leave
me eight children to support, or else I&#8217;ll die a rheumaticky
old maid. Will that satisfy you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk that way,&#8221; said Scott, sharply. &#8220;It&#8217;s
unlucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlucky? Are you superstitious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;ve noticed that people who are always
expecting bad luck usually get it. I&#8217;d hate to have
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he stopped, and Polly caught a look in his
eyes that startled her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Die a rheumaticky old maid?&#8221; she said, nervously.
&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to, either, but it seems to me that
the number of people who get out of this world without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
a lot of trouble of some kind or other is a pretty small
one, so you needn&#8217;t begrudge me a few years of easy
going. What was Mrs. Conrad&#8217;s trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s had a good deal of it first and last, but I was
thinking of her husband&#8217;s death, two years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know her then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? No, indeed, I never met her before to-night,
but Hard told me, and so did Herrick. I don&#8217;t reckon
Hard would mind my telling you her story, now
you&#8217;ve met her. You see, he and she were young folks
together in Boston. I guess they sort of played at being
in love with each other, like young folks do. Then
her father died, and left her with hardly anything, and
that woke &#8217;em up. It made things look more serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard wanted to marry her, but she wouldn&#8217;t. She
had a voice and she wanted a career; so she went to
Europe. That&#8217;s where she met Herrick and took lessons
of him. Then, suddenly, instead of going on the
stage, she married one of those floating Englishmen.
Met him in Paris, married him, and came over here
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t she care for Mr. Hard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s pretty hard sometimes to know who a
woman does care for,&#8221; said Scott, candidly. &#8220;But if
she did, she must have got over it. Or maybe she got
tired of the singing business and took Conrad in a fit
of the blues. I&#8217;ve known &#8217;em to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Men, I suppose, never marry for reasons of that
sort!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Men? Lord, yes, men&#8217;ll do anything&mdash;most of
&#8217;em,&#8221; grinned Scott, cheerfully. &#8220;We&#8217;re a rum lot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
Anyhow, Mrs. Conrad married her Englishman and
came over to the coffee plantation with him. I guess
they had some trouble like everybody else has had these
last few years, but they managed to weather it. Then,
about two years ago, they went on a hunting trip, up in
the mountains, just the two of them and a Mexican
boy. While they were there, Conrad shot himself
while he was cleaning his gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was hopeless from the first and she knew it, but
she stayed alone with him and sent the boy back to the
ranch for a doctor. He died while they were there
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s eyes had tears in them. She was staring
wistfully at the mountains. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to think what
it would mean&mdash;being up there, alone, with someone
you loved who was dying,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;No
wonder little things don&#8217;t bother a woman who&#8217;s been
through a thing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s those things that make character, I guess,&#8221;
said Scott, thoughtfully. &#8220;Or break it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Mr. Hard ever been down there to see
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s a proud streak in Hard&mdash;or maybe he&#8217;s
got over his feeling for her. He never would let her
know he was in the country. I rather guess Herrick
planned this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder? Oh, what is it? What do you see?&#8221;
she cried, as she noticed that Scott&#8217;s attention was no
longer on her, but was fastened upon the dark foothills
which rose between them and the mountains.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; wish I had my glasses! Looks to
me like fellows riding&mdash;do you see &#8217;em? Over there,
coming through that darkish spot between the foothills?
Wonder if we&#8217;re in for another row?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;yes, it is! Coming this way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go in and tell them to put out the lights and stop
that noise quick!&#8221; Scott&#8217;s voice was hard and sharp.
Polly darted into the house. Scott strained his eyes to
watch the party of riders racking recklessly down the
dark roadway from the hills. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be Pachuca!&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t come back. It must be
that damned young Angel. Well, I guess we&#8217;re in for
trouble before daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Hard was at his elbow. Scott
turned and saw that the house was dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bunch on horseback&mdash;see, over yonder?
They&#8217;re making good time; they&#8217;ll be on us in half a
minute. Where&#8217;s Herrick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting the rifles. Where are the horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the pasture, up by the river. They&#8217;ll not find
them in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better have the women go up there,
too?&#8221; said Hard, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe so. If they&#8217;re bound for us, there&#8217;s
no time. I think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Scott,&#8221; Clara Conrad&#8217;s voice came softly from
the dark doorway, &#8220;if that&#8217;s Angel Gonzales why can&#8217;t
we all go&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who it is, and the moon&#8217;s too strong
out there&mdash;they&#8217;d spot you in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t sit here and do nothing!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can do as you please.&#8221; Scott&#8217;s voice was
ugly with the ugliness of strained nerves. &#8220;I say stick
to shelter while you&#8217;ve got it.&#8221; He drew his revolver
as he spoke and examined it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming fast.&#8221; Hard&#8217;s voice was tense.
Herrick carrying three rifles came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get inside&mdash;everybody!&#8221; ordered Scott. The
party had turned in from the road and were dashing
toward them. Mrs. Conrad and Polly were already in
the house. The men followed. &#8220;They ride like Indians,
Hard; I believe it&#8217;s Yaquis on the warpath!&#8221;
He and Hard stationed themselves at the open windows
in the darkness. &#8220;I&#8217;m for waiting till they attack us;
what do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Let them make the first move.&#8221;</p>
<p>The intruders were at the gate. Now they swept in,
a couple of score of them. They whirled and made
for the barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re Indians, all right,&#8221; whispered Scott.
&#8220;They&#8217;re after the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silence was complete for a few seconds, the
women obediently crouching in the darkest corner
scarcely seeming to breathe, Scott and Hard, hidden
behind the light curtains, keeping their eyes fixed upon
the swiftly moving figures outside, Herrick standing
just within the doorway. Suddenly, cries broke the
stillness. Two of the Yaquis who had entered the
barn came out with the news. The yells were of rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;No horses!&#8221; grinned Scott. &#8220;Their feelings are
hurt. Here&#8217;s where the play begins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re firing the barn,&#8221; said Hard, grimly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>They were. It blazed like a child&#8217;s bonfire and the
shouts and curses of the disappointed Yaquis rose
with the flames.</p>
<p>In another moment the Indians had ridden toward
the house. Polly, who in spite of orders, had crept
toward the window saw them in amazement. Between
the moon and the light of the blazing barn, they were
distinctly visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they can&#8217;t be Indians!&#8221; she exclaimed, at
Scott&#8217;s elbow. &#8220;They&#8217;re just like our Mexicans!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you expect them to wear scalp locks? Get out
of range, quick! Hard, cover the second chap, there.
I&#8217;m going to give the first boy a shock. They&#8217;ll be in
here in half a minute if I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>His shot rang out and the bullet flew over the Indian&#8217;s
head. It was close enough to make him pull his
horse to its haunches while those behind him did the
same.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;m talking to him, you women slide out
the back door,&#8221; muttered Scott, hurriedly. &#8220;Make
for the stream and the horses while they&#8217;re watching
us. Hello, out there, what do you want?&#8221; he said in
Spanish.</p>
<p>Mrs. Conrad gripped Polly&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Come!&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t!&#8221; demurred the girl. &#8220;We can&#8217;t leave
them like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; repeated Clara, angrily. &#8220;Do you want to
fall into their hands?&#8221; Polly, too frightened by her
tone to resist, crept softly behind her. They heard the
Indian at whom Scott had fired answer. To Polly it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
meant nothing, but Clara&#8217;s ears, accustomed to the
tongue, caught an angry demand for horses, food and
money.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t any of those things. We&#8217;ve just been
raided&mdash;cleaned out&mdash;we&#8217;re as poor as you are,&#8221; was
Scott&#8217;s reply. The Indians conferred together. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a question of whether they think we&#8217;re lying or not,&#8221;
said Scott, drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. And they have unfortunately every reason
to believe that a white man usually is,&#8221; replied
Hard. &#8220;What&#8217;s the play if they come at us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot as many as we can,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
do the rest. That&#8217;s why I sent the women off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so. Well, here goes. I ought to be
able to get a couple before I cash in though I&#8217;m not
considered very dangerous with firearms,&#8221; replied
Hard, calmly, though his heart was registering something
approaching acute blood pressure.</p>
<p>From the leader came in angry Spanish: &#8220;We don&#8217;t
believe you! We&#8217;ll come and get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; yelled Herrick. Instantly, a dozen
Yaquis were off their horses and running toward the
house, shooting as they came. As instantly, two of
the leaders fell in the path of the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good boy, Herrick!&#8221; cried Scott. &#8220;Let &#8217;em have
it again!&#8221; he yelled, as the Indians, halted for a moment
by the fall of their men, came on again. The
shots rang out again but this time no one fell. Hard
felt something sing by him in the darkness and thanked
God that the women were not there. Herrick rushed
over for more cartridges.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming!&#8221; he shouted, excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em come. Some of &#8217;em are coming to something
they won&#8217;t like,&#8221; growled Scott. &#8220;Look out&mdash;in
the doorway!&#8221;</p>
<p>Two Indians had burst their way into the house, but
disconcerted by its utter darkness after the moonlight
outside, paused a moment to get their bearings. Scott,
Hard and Herrick shot with one accord. One Indian
came on; the other uttered a cry of pain; then both
dashed outside for the shelter of the veranda. There
was silence; the Indians hesitating in doubt as to their
companions&#8217; fate, the white men uncertain as to what
form the attack would take next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the women gone?&#8221; Herrick called softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Hard. &#8220;Are you all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So. They whistle through my hair but they do
not touch me,&#8221; replied the musician, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come!&#8221; cried Scott, impatiently.
&#8220;Watch your shots!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indians were coming, and coming in a body.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, it&#8217;s going to be all day with us in half a
minute!&#8221; gasped Scott. &#8220;Let &#8217;em have it as hard as
you can, boys. We may be able to hold &#8217;em long
enough to give the women a chance to get the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard clenched his teeth and bent his eye on his
rifle. In another moment the invaders would be upon
them&mdash;when, sharp and decisive came the sound of
shots; shots from among the foothills, followed by
yells. There was a cry from the Indian who led the
rush; a wavering of the line; and a stop. They broke
into loud talk. In the meantime, the shots and yells
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
continued. They seemed to come from two directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another crowd back in the hills. They&#8217;ve
got another fight on their hands,&#8221; muttered Scott,
listening. &#8220;It&#8217;s a flank attack and these fellows don&#8217;t
like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is. Hear that!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were more yells; the Yaquis outside flung
themselves into their saddles and in another moment
the two wounded men lying near the windows were all
that remained of the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;By golly, I&#8217;ve heard of luck before, but this is a
case of the pure and unadulterated article,&#8221; said Scott,
awed.</p>
<p>Hard did not reply. He was taking a deep breath&mdash;the
first in several minutes. Herrick whistled cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless it&#8217;s Angel Gonzales,&#8221; continued Scott, pensively.
&#8220;In that case it&#8217;s a question of &#8216;Go it, old
woman; go it, b&#8217;ar.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go after the horses and the women,&#8221; said
Hard. &#8220;The quicker we hit the trail for home the
better my circulation&#8217;s going to be. I think the Hards
must have deteriorated considerably since the battle
of Lexington. I&#8217;m getting to be a regular old
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re a pretty good pal in a fight,
old man,&#8221; he said, simply. &#8220;I think you winged one
of those birds outside. Shall we go and have a look?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; replied Hard, decidedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s unpleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
enough to me to kill a man without pawing him over
afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott went outside and looked over the victims of
the fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead, both of them,&#8221; he said, briefly. &#8220;Come on,
let&#8217;s get out of this before their friends come back.&#8221;
And to the sounds of yells and shots in the distance
they made their way toward the stream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT RIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>When Li Yow clattered up the trail leading out of
the river bed and up the mesa, he was a happy man,
in spite of the fact that a horse was to him the last
means of locomotion that he would have chosen for an
all night trip, with the possible exception of a camel
or an elephant. Except as objects for his scientific
skill, horses were not dear to his heart. A wagon, a
train, an automobile, these were sensible conveyances
for an intellectual man of an old and distinguished
family going about his business, but a horse, never!</p>
<p>Not that Li would have admitted that his family was
old. Distinguished, perhaps, but scarcely old when it
only counted its ancestry through some eight or nine
hundred years. In China that is to be classed among
the blatantly new. He was happy, however, because
he was being given a chance to use his skill for that
great purpose for which it had been acquired, the alleviation
of pain.</p>
<p>Li was a student, and for five years he had had very
little opportunity for the work that he loved. With
the patience of the Oriental, he had toiled at an inferior
art; now opportunity had come, and so eager
was he to grasp it, that a twenty-mile ride on an uncongenial
animal, in the night, did not deter him. Not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
that he was afraid of the dark as we like to think the
Chinese are. Li Yow had a philosophy, old when the
Christian philosophy was born, which amply sufficed to
relieve his mind of any superstitious terrors. Mexicans
on the rampage, and Yaquis on the warpath, did not,
however, come under the category of superstitious
fears, and he heartily hoped he might accomplish his
journey without meeting either of them.</p>
<p>He rode Scott&#8217;s big roan, Cochise, a common-sense
animal which could be trusted to the tender mercies
of what its master called &#8220;a crazy Chink.&#8221; This excellent
beast understood thoroughly the art of saving
his strength, and curbing any foolish enthusiasm on
the part of a rider to race up-hill or to exhaust one&#8217;s
wind too early in the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirit and a bit of deviltry are all right in a horse
or a woman, I&#8217;ll grant you,&#8221; Scott used to say when
anyone derided the roan. &#8220;But the horse or the
woman who lives with me has got to have common
sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Li Yow and Cochise trotted placidly along the
mesa, one thinking of the joys of surgery, and the
other of the pleasure of feeding in one&#8217;s own corral.
They had been out a couple of hours perhaps, and Li,
moved by the beauty of the night, quoted a fragment
of eighth century poetry and turned in his saddle to
see how far he had come&mdash;when, suddenly, he gave an
exclamation of horror!</p>
<p>Back of him, across the river bed, back of the
round-topped hill, from exactly the spot where Casa
Grande stood, he saw the tops of flames shooting up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
against the sky line! Something was being burned.
Something sizable, or its flames would not rise so
high. It must be either Casa Grande, its barn, or
both. Li&#8217;s heart stood still. He stopped Cochise in
sympathy with that important organ. What to do?
At Casa Grande was a friend to whom he was attached.
Things of a most unpleasant nature might be happening
to him&mdash;could he ride away and leave him?</p>
<p>On the other hand, what could he do&mdash;a lone
Chinese, unarmed except for a formidable surgical apparatus?
After all, they had two horses and perhaps
they had seen the brigands coming and had escaped.
Still, if he went back they would have three horses.
The women could ride and the men could ride and
tie. Li groaned in spirit. He hated walking more
than he hated riding.</p>
<p>Obviously his duty was to go back and offer his help
such as it was. If they were fighting, it would not be
worth much, unless he could persuade a Mexican or
two to stand still while he stabbed them with a lancet.
With a sigh, Li turned Cochise in the direction of
Casa Grande and applied an encouraging dig of the
heel.</p>
<p>Cochise, however, saw things differently. He had
started for Athens. Athens was home and a good
place at that. He saw no reason for going back just
to please an ignoramus who didn&#8217;t know how to ride
and who would probably change his mind again before
they had gone a mile. Consequently, when Li kicked,
Cochise threw his head in the air and made crab-like
motions with his legs. Li pulled and Cochise reared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
Li, mindful of past instructions, loosed the reins and
Cochise whirled. Li leaned over and patted the horse&#8217;s
neck and Cochise bucked.</p>
<p>It was a nice exhibition of obstinacy on the part of
both man and beast, and no one there but the moon to
witness it. The buck, however, did the business. A
bump and a rattle reminded Li Yow of his precious
medical chest&mdash;absolutely unreplaceable&mdash;and with a
frightened:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, thou son of evil, thou animal of ill omen!&#8221;
he gave in; and Cochise, secure in his victory, settled
down to a trot again. &#8220;Ah, well, a sensible man
spends no time in weeping over the inevitable,&#8221; meditated
Li. &#8220;What is to be, will be. The young man
with the injured leg is the gainer by thy obstinacy, oh,
vile beast!&#8221;</p>
<p>At daybreak a tired man and a stiff horse arrived at
Athens. Mrs. Van Zandt saw them because she was
up attending to Adams who was suffering. She hailed
the Chinaman from her doorway, bathrobed and
boudoir capped as she was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Marc Scott?&#8221; she called anxiously, as
she recognized Cochise.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, lady,&#8221; replied Li, in his professional manner.
&#8220;This not Mr. Scott, this Li Yow from Casa Grande.
I come see sick boy,&#8221; and he rolled off the horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s good, he needs you! Leave the horse
and come in.&#8221; Li complied and Cochise, released,
started wearily for the corral. &#8220;See here,&#8221; Mrs. Van
Zandt led the way to the bedroom, &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re
pretty well used up, ain&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m going to get you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
something to eat in a minute. Did you have a hard
ride?&#8221; She had got a light and looked at him curiously.
Li Yow did look very much used up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hurry a great lot,&#8221; he said, simply. &#8220;I want go
back but the horse he want come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you want to go back for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire. I see big fire at Casa Grande,&#8221; replied the
Chinaman, gravely. &#8220;I much afraid the bandits burn
the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt pulled him suddenly from the bedroom
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good land, man, don&#8217;t let the boy hear you! He&#8217;s
half out of his head now. What do you mean? Has
Casa Grande been raided?&#8221;</p>
<p>Li nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Pachuca?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He come morning, take everything&mdash;horses,
chow, money, everything! Then Mr. Scott&#8217;s folks
they come in afternoon. Only thlee horse for
everybody. Mr. Scott say he mend wagon and they
come over to-morrow. I come to-night to see sick boy.
When I get up on mesa I see fire&mdash;don&#8217;t know who
make him but mebbe bandits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt turned pale. Clutching her bathrobe
tightly she made for the door. &#8220;Look here,&#8221; she
called, over her shoulder, &#8220;you look after the boy and
mind you don&#8217;t spill any of that news before him. I&#8217;ll
get you some breakfast and see what&#8217;s to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she came back. &#8220;They were all right when
you left them? The young lady, too?&#8221; she queried,
anxiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they all light. Both them ladies all light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both! Who&#8217;s the other?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Van
Zandt, instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hellick got flend&mdash;Mrs. Conlad,&#8221; said Li,
wearily. &#8220;She come day before yest&#8217;day&mdash;from
Mexico City. Mr. Hard&#8217;s flend, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, now what do you suppose the
heathen means by that?&#8221; gasped the astonished
woman. &#8220;Come here,&#8221; she added, sternly, and seizing
the Chinaman by the sleeve of his blouse, she led him
into the room occupied by Polly. Dramatically, she
pointed to the photograph on the wall. &#8220;Is that the
woman you&#8217;re talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>Li examined the face gravely and nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;only younger here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van released him suddenly. &#8220;All right, go
on in and see the boy,&#8221; she said, and hurried down
the street. &#8220;Fire and bandits&mdash;and I let that poor
girl go over there with those men!&#8221; she gasped.
&#8220;And what on earth is that woman doing at Casa
Grande? It&#8217;s either a scandal or a romance, that&#8217;s a
cinch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Whose horse was that?
Great snakes, Mrs. Van, what the devil&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Johnson,
hastily and scantily attired, came down the street,
followed by the others. Cochise had waked up the
camp. Mrs. Van looked at them tragically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Casa Grande Chinaman come over to see
Jimmy. He rode Cochise,&#8221; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d he ride Cochise for? What&#8217;s come over
Marc Scott, lendin&#8217; Cochise to a Chink?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, something awful has happened,&#8221; and she
burst into the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the heathen go back to help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he tried to, but Cochise got scared and
wouldn&#8217;t go. What do you suppose it is ?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, I dunno! Don&#8217;t sound like Pachuca; he
wouldn&#8217;t come back a second time. Sure looks
bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the feller says Mrs. Conrad&#8217;s there. What&#8217;s
he mean by that, do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hard&#8217;s friend; the widow woman that lives
down South. Upon my word, Tom Johnson, I do believe
that&#8217;s the woman and the trouble that the ouija
meant and I thought all the time it was talking about
Polly Street!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno, I&#8217;m sure. Where&#8217;s Cochise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone down to the corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;d better go down and give him the once
over. They&#8217;ve probably rode him to death between
&#8217;em. Gosh, I&#8217;m sorry to hear that news!&#8221; and Tom
strode off, sadly, followed by the others. &#8220;Poor old
chap,&#8221; he murmured, a few minutes later, as he took
the saddle off Cochise. &#8220;Can&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; for your
boss, so I&#8217;ll do what I can for you. Pretty well petered
out, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Tom, what are we going to do about this
Casa Grande business, anyhow?&#8221; demanded O&#8217;Grady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, with a dynamited track, a busted auto, a
smashed &#8217;phone connection and a foundered horse,
what would you suggest doing?&#8221; demanded Johnson,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
pessimistically. &#8220;Walkin&#8217; ain&#8217;t so durned good in this
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could get to Conejo we could get Mendoza
to drive us over to Casa Grande,&#8221; hazarded Williams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that ain&#8217;t a bad idea for you, Jack,&#8221; said
Tom, patronizingly. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll stretch my legs in
that direction after breakfast. Suppose we go up and
see what the Doc says about Jimmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, the doctor had examined his patient&#8217;s
leg, quietly ignoring the flood of excited questions
hurled at him by the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Him velly bad,&#8221; he declared at length. &#8220;You
keep him still while I get bullet out, mebbe he get well.
You talk a heap and mebbe I cut him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cut him off and I&#8217;ll cut your liver out, Li, you
sabe?&#8221; grinned Adams, gamely. &#8220;Anyhow, it&#8217;s
blamed good of you to ride over here. I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re
sore, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt coming up the road with the tray
in her arms met the men coming up from the corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did suppose I&#8217;d see myself carrying breakfast
to a Chinese,&#8221; she said, wearily, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t
tell these days what&#8217;ll come your way. I know exactly
how that poor guy feels. I rode over to Casa Grande
once on Cochise. He&#8217;s wide and he&#8217;s rough and anyone
who wants to ride him twenty miles is welcome to
him as far as I&#8217;m concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>The train gang hung around to hear the verdict on
Jimmy Adams. They were much relieved to hear that
the operation was to be one of probing rather than of
cutting. They had had some gloomy discussions on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
that point which had ended in consulting the mail order
catalogue in order to see whether it advertised artificial
limbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants one of you to help,&#8221; said Mrs. Van, coming
out of the room. &#8220;I wisht you would. I feel that
nasty this morning that the sight of blood would just
about finish me. Go on in, Tom.&#8221; Tom went in.
Mrs. Van set the tray on the table. &#8220;Seems funny to
be waiting on a cook, don&#8217;t it? But I suppose it&#8217;s different
when he&#8217;s tending the sick, and I&#8217;ll say he&#8217;s
clean. He washed his hands before he touched Jimmy.
I watched him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s more than old Estrada over in Conejo
does,&#8221; said O&#8217;Grady. &#8220;He pulled a tooth for me last
winter and he come in from feedin&#8217; his pigs to do it.
Right plumb into my mouth he started to put his dirty
fist. &#8216;No,&#8217; says I, &#8216;you wash that mitt first. Afterward
you can suit yourself.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You better get a swig of whiskey ready for Tom,&#8221;
suggested the brakeman, solicitously. &#8220;Them operations
is ugly things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Mrs. Van, hurrying to the cabinet and
taking down the bottle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE WAGON</h3>
</div>

<p>Herrick stopped before they had gone a dozen
yards from the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on and find the women,&#8221; he said, curtly. &#8220;I
have something to do before they come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Scott stared at the little man
uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So. Do you want them to see those ugly bodies?&#8221;
he pointed to the two dead Yaquis, stretched ghastly
and plain in the moonlight. &#8220;I shall pull them into the
shadow of the bushes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s nervy for a piano player, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;
murmured Scott, as he and Hard turned the corner of
the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, myself, that there&#8217;s a lot of rot talked
about the artistic temperament,&#8221; replied Hard, drily.
&#8220;The war showed us that poets could fight as courageously
as plumbers, and I&#8217;ve always thought that
when you got the real unadulterated article in artistic
temperament, you usually got with it a distinctly cruel
streak. I believe that you and I hated killing those
Indians a lot more than Herrick did, though he&#8217;ll
probably throw a nervous chill over it after a while
and compose a piece about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe so,&#8221; assented Scott. &#8220;He&#8217;s the only
artistic chap I ever got real close to and I don&#8217;t mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
admitting he&#8217;s mighty queer&mdash;but he ain&#8217;t yellow. I&#8217;ll
say that for him after to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were passing a clump of bushes as he spoke
and two dark figures started forth. Scott instinctively
put his hand on his gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; gasped the shorter figure, &#8220;what has happened?
Are you shot? Who is running away&mdash;you
or they?&#8221; She seized Scott&#8217;s wrists with a clutching
hold.</p>
<p>Scott laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s how you obey orders, is it?
Where are the horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We stayed right here,&#8221; faltered
Polly. &#8220;I want to know if you&#8217;re hurt!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not if I know it, and I usually recognize bullets
when they hit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; insisted the other woman.
&#8220;Have they gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re fighting somebody over in the hills&mdash;we
don&#8217;t know who it is,&#8221; replied Hard. &#8220;Probably
Angel Gonzales. These fellows were evidently an advance
guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to get out of here before they come
back,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell how long that will
last&mdash;and whoever licks, we don&#8217;t want to be hanging
around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll burn the place, I suppose,&#8221; said Mrs. Conrad,
wearily. &#8220;May I go back and get some things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott hesitated. &#8220;I think we ought to get away,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;But one of us will have to go back to get
Herrick and the saddles&mdash;if you can hurry&mdash;go with
her, Hard, and I&#8217;ll go after the horses.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Saddles?&#8221; Polly spoke suddenly. &#8220;Weren&#8217;t they
in the barn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; luckily I put them in the wagon when I was
tinkering with it,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;We&#8217;ve only two
horses, you know, and I want you women to ride
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By&mdash;by ourselves?&#8221; Mrs. Conrad&#8217;s usually cheerful
voice sounded a little frightened. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find
that trail in the dark; I&#8217;m not Li Yow, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The horses will take you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please let&#8217;s keep together!&#8221; pleaded Polly.
&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we all go in the wagon the way you
planned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for one reason, the harness was in the
barn and was burned,&#8221; said Scott, with some irritation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Herrick has a lot of old junk of that sort in his
storeroom,&#8221; volunteered Hard. &#8220;I believe you could
patch up one. Those sounds have died away&mdash;the
fight&#8217;s over,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back and have a
look, and see what Herrick says.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause and the two men consulted anxiously
together. It was very still&mdash;not a sound from
the direction of the hills. It really did look as though
the attack had been followed by flight. Scott, against
what he afterward called his better judgment, but what
was really only a disinclination to change his mind,
gave in, and the two men walked on ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re going in the wagon, Hard, we&#8217;ve got to
go by the road, and I don&#8217;t stir a step on that road till
I know whether this deviltry is over for the night or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
not. We&#8217;ll camp down here for a few hours, and
start by daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? The horses need the rest and so do we.
I say camp, by all means.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everything seemed harmless at the ranch house.
Herrick, who had performed his unpleasant task, was
studying the extent of the damage, which seemed to be
confined to broken windows. When consulted, he approved
of the idea of an early morning start in the
wagon and believed that out of the odds and ends of
harness in the storeroom something could be patched
up and made to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right then.&#8221; Scott&#8217;s voice was emphatic. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
fix the wagon first thing in the morning. And now,
let&#8217;s all turn in and catch a few winks before daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll sleep a minute,&#8221; said Polly, as
the two women were left alone in the room which
Clara Conrad had been occupying. &#8220;I&#8217;ll throw my
cloak around me and lie down on the couch. I feel
awfully strung up, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the older woman. &#8220;But I&#8217;m going to
try to sleep, and so must you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Clara did not expect to sleep.
The meeting with Henry Hard had brought up old
memories&mdash;memories both happy and sad. He had
changed little, the tall, thin, sandy-haired man. It was
good, oh so good, to have something back again from
the old life! As she closed her eyes and put away
from her the events of the day, old scenes came back
with a clearness that they had not worn for many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
years. The old houses; the quiet, cultured, elderly
men and women, the gayer young ones, herself and
Hard among them; the dinners, dances, concerts; the
summer days on the water, and the rides&mdash;all came
back as though they had been but yesterday, and all on
account of this one man who had played so important
a part in them.</p>
<p>She realized, as she lay there in the darkness, that
without putting the thought clearly, she had had deeply
imbedded in her mind the idea that she would see him
or hear something about him when she went back to
Boston. She was not in love with him, but she had
never forgotten him and she would never feel about
him as she did about so many of the others who had
played parts in her old life. Soothed by the thought,
she drifted into a calm and restful sleep.</p>
<p>Polly, however, was too unskilled in the management
of her thoughts to be able to relax at will. She lay
quietly, so as not to disturb the other woman, but her
mind was whirling. She lived again each event of the
past two days; the raid on the mine, the ride with
Pachuca, his escape, the trip to Casa Grande, and the
growing companionship with Scott&mdash;the look she had
surprised in his eyes only an hour ago when she had
stood with him on the veranda, looking at the distant
mountains; and then the dreadful minutes spent behind
the bushes, listening to the guns of the attacking
Yaquis.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I thought a golf tournament was exciting!&#8221;
she said, smiling in the dark. Softly she rose and crept
to the window. It was very beautiful out there; mountains,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
hills, bushes, all a study in absolute stillness.
The only sound that came to her ears was the howl of
a wolf in the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming in at just the right moment,&#8221; smiled the
girl. &#8220;What a country for effects! Oh dear, I believe
I could sleep out there in the hammock if it wasn&#8217;t
too chilly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking the couch cover over her arm she crept softly
out of the door and out on to the veranda where the
hammock swayed gently in the breeze. Polly adjusted
herself in it with care; a fall would bring all the occupants
of the house out with a bound.</p>
<p>&#8220;First they&#8217;d bound and then they&#8217;d fuss,&#8221; she said
to herself. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be fussed at, I just want
to snatch a few winks out under this gorgeous sky. I
don&#8217;t understand how when skies and stars and
mountains are all laid out for them, artists want to do
the red and green futurist horrors that they love so.
Now, what&#8217;s that noise?&#8221;</p>
<p>A queer kind of noise it was. Polly sat up quite
suddenly. It seemed to come from behind a clump of
bushes some distance to the right. It was a pounding,
scraping sort of noise, not very loud, but distinctly disconcerting.
You got the impression that whoever was
doing it was trying not to make any more noise than he
could help. Polly&#8217;s heart beat rapidly. She must call
one of the men. She rose unsteadily and at the same
moment the noise stopped. A tall figure stepped
out from behind the bushes and came toward the
house.</p>
<p>Polly stepped back into the shadow of the porch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
She was about to dive into the open window when another
sound caught her ear. The man was whistling
softly&mdash;whistling the Slumber Motif from Die Walküre!
Polly laughed aloud. She had taken Henry
Hard for a bandit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, what are you doing up on deck?&#8221; he said,
whimsically. &#8220;I thought we&#8217;d sent the passengers below
and battened down the hatches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep, so I came out here. What are
you doing with that pick? Was it you I heard digging?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott and me. I came up for a match.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can you be digging for at this time of
night? Not buried treasure?&#8221; eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child, I hate to disappoint you, knowing
your feelings on the subject. If you must know, we
killed a couple of Yaquis and we&#8217;re burying them on
what we&#8217;d call at home &#8216;the lawn.&#8217; It&#8217;s rather awful,
but we can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed them!&#8221; Polly&#8217;s eyes were wide with horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rotten business, if you ask me, both killing
and burying. I&#8217;m just beginning to form a faint idea
of the sort of thing the youngsters we sent abroad had
to face. I was keeping up my courage by whistling.
Won&#8217;t you go to bed like a nice girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I couldn&#8217;t stand it in there in the dark. It
doesn&#8217;t seem so bad out here. Go on&mdash;don&#8217;t bother
about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Hard had got his match and joined Scott
again behind the bushes, Polly sat and listened to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
ominous sounds, her pleasant reflections quite at an
end.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how it always goes. You begin to feel
comfortable and pleased with your philosophy and
yourself and then reality comes along and swats you
one in the eye. I will not think of those Indians! I&#8217;ll
think of Bob and Emma. Wonder what kind of a
nurse Emma makes? Not that she&#8217;ll have a chance to
try, poor lamb. Those trained ones will shoo her off
and flirt with Bob themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was some time before the two men finished their
ugly job. Polly saw them come out from behind the
bushes and go into the house by the back door. She
stretched herself sleepily&mdash;it was beginning to be a bit
chilly, even when wrapped in a coat and a serape.
Perhaps it would be wiser to go in. She folded the
serape and started for the door, only to stop midway as
Scott came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d all gone to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you know you ought to,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
blame you for not wanting to. Those mountains get
one, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were standing exactly where they had stood so
short a time ago, but so much had happened since that
it seemed hours gone by. It wasn&#8217;t to be expected, the
girl thought, that they could go on from where they
had left off. She looked up. He was staring at the
mountains. She felt a ridiculous mixture of relief and
disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;They get me,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I never knew I
was so fond of mountains.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the mystery of them. You have the feeling
that things are going on in and about them that you
don&#8217;t know&mdash;that nobody&#8217;ll ever know. I remember
the first time I climbed a big mountain&mdash;up in Colorado.
When I was about three-quarters of the way up
I looked down on one of those little mountain lakes&mdash;just
as blue as that ring of yours&mdash;set in the brown of
the mountain. It made me feel as if I&#8217;d struck gold.
I couldn&#8217;t believe that anybody but the Indians and I
had ever seen that lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott was leaning against the post of the veranda,
still looking at the mountains. Suddenly he turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little girl, I think you&#8217;d better be going in and getting
a few hours of sleep,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Four o&#8217;clock
comes along awfully early in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly said nothing. She picked up the serape again
and turned to go. Then she came back again, holding
out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Scott, I haven&#8217;t said a word to show that I&#8217;m
grateful for what you did to-night. You saved my
life, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott took the hand and smiled down into the serious
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go that far,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those fellows
who horned into our fight did that, I reckon. I sure
tried to, though, if you&#8217;d like to shake hands on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You risked your own life, anyhow, so please don&#8217;t
spoil my story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, put it that I&#8217;ll be delighted to save your life
any time you say, even if I get my hide full of holes
for doing it. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; agreed Polly, heartily. &#8220;You
may call me at twenty minutes of four, if you please,&#8221;
and she disappeared into the house.</p>
<p>Scott stood a moment after she was gone, an odd
little smile on his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if she&#8217;d care&mdash;or would it be another case
of Joyce Henderson?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, serve me
right for a fool if it was!&#8221; He kicked a stick out of
his way as he made for the wagon. &#8220;What have you
got to offer a girl, anyhow?&#8221; He took a pocket torch
out and examined the wheel of the wagon. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
better looking wheels and then again I&#8217;ve seen worse,&#8221;
he decided, pessimistically. &#8220;If our luck holds we&#8217;ll
make it. Doggone it, being civilized makes an awful
idiot of a man. I&#8217;m going to dream of those poor
Yaquis we&#8217;ve just buried, sure as shoe leather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Four o&#8217;clock does indeed come along early when you
have not closed your eyes before midnight. It also
comes along chilly and dark and generally uncomfortable.
The women were awakened by Hard, who had
to knock loudly on their door in order to accomplish it.
They tumbled to their feet and performed the necessary
dressing operations in the dark, except for a candle
which Clara lighted cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think that people once lived by candlelight!&#8221;
murmured Polly, sleepily. &#8220;Were born, married,
and finally died by it. Well, the race has come
up a peg, I&#8217;ll say that for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Conrad was ready first. She was very rapid,
in a quiet, unhurried fashion. In her corduroy skirt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
and jacket, she looked very girlish. Polly mentally
took five years off her estimate of her new acquaintance&#8217;s
age.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awfully natural looking woman, too,&#8221; she commented,
silently. &#8220;Most of the pretty women I know
at home are always doing things to themselves&mdash;fussing
over their looks; but she just seems to keep herself
fresh and neat and let it go at that, and she manages to
look young and handsome. As for me, I&#8217;m a rag and
I look it, but perhaps as there are no tremendous beauties
around, I&#8217;ll pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed Mrs. Conrad into the kitchen, where
she found her busy with Herrick over the breakfast.
The pleasant odors of burning wood and boiling coffee
had already made themselves noticed. Scott, in a corner
of the kitchen, was working over the harness which
he was getting into a condition possible for use. He
looked up and nodded as Polly entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your gentleman friend left a few things; we won&#8217;t
have to starve on the road,&#8221; he said, drily. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a side of bacon&mdash;wonder why he left that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he didn&#8217;t see it,&#8221; suggested Polly,
sweetly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s the answer. There, I reckon that
harness will take us as far as Athens, if we have a bit
of luck. If you&#8217;ll bring out what you want to take,
Mrs. Conrad, we&#8217;ll pack it in the wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only a couple of suitcases. My trunks went
by rail to the border&mdash;that is, they started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about you, Herrick? Afraid we can&#8217;t take
the piano.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Herrick looked up in some surprise. &#8220;Me?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I am not going with you, my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not going with us? But, Victor, you can&#8217;t stay
here alone.&#8221; Mrs. Conrad&#8217;s voice had real solicitude
in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Li will return and you shall send him
first to Conejo to buy provisions. When things settle
down, my men will come back and we shall go to work
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to stick by the ranch?&#8221; demanded
Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my home. What else have I?&#8221; The little
man&#8217;s voice was sad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Scott, after a moment.
&#8220;The best way to hang on to property just now
is to sit down on it. We&#8217;ll send Li over to Conejo with
the wagon and he can load up. If you get into trouble,
remember you&#8217;ve got friends in this country.&#8221; And the
two men shook hands heartily as Scott tramped off to
the wagon.</p>
<p>Polly did not see the parting between the musician
and Clara Conrad, but the latter looked, when she came
out of the house, as though she had been crying, and
the little man looked more pathetic than ever as he
stood alone in the doorway waving them good-bye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he ought to say there?&#8221; demanded
Polly, as Scott helped her into the wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, but he&#8217;s obstinate and you can&#8217;t move
him once he makes up his mind. There&#8217;s a lot of the
woman in every artistic man, I believe,&#8221; grunted Scott,
disgustedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>A little later, with the two Athens horses hitched to
the mountain wagon, the party started out, Hard driving.
The road led out through the hills where the fighting
had been only a few hours ago. There was no sign
of what had happened. It was a poor road, narrow,
rough and little used. There were ruts in it and
chuck-holes, turns and an occasional arroyo. It was
rather ghostly, too, driving at this hour; the chill, early
morning feel of the air, the fading moon, the faint
pinkness hanging over the mountains suggesting the
coming dawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing you miss around here is the cattle,&#8221; said
Scott. &#8220;Up in New Mexico you&#8217;d be starting out this
time in the morning and you&#8217;d see the range cattle looking
at you, sort of surprised to see folks around so
early in the morning; some of &#8217;em still lying down and
napping. Around here raising cattle hasn&#8217;t been very
popular the last few years&mdash;too hazardous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Polly, I want you to notice that funny little
house over there,&#8221; said Hard, pointing to his right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, there was reason for the question. The little
cabin had been built tightly against a hill, with the
hill scooped out to make the back part. A closer look
revealed a burro standing on the roof beside the chimney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the first time I ever saw a burro on a
roof!&#8221; declared Polly. &#8220;Who lives there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Mexican family named Soria,&#8221; replied Hard.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over and see if they know anything about the
fighting last night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t need to,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;Here comes the
whole population.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it seemed. There was an old woman&mdash;very old,
very thin and very brown; a younger one, half a dozen
youngsters, several dogs and finally the burro. The
family were clad in every sort of decrepit garment.
Polly thought she had rarely seen so pitiful an assemblage;
and yet they did not look particularly unhappy,
except the younger woman, who hung back and seemed
to have been crying. They had seen the wagon and
had come out to find out what was going on. The
older woman came directly to the wagon, while the
younger one stood a little way off, a baby in her arms,
and the other children hanging around her. She was
rather a pretty woman, or would have been with half a
chance. It is difficult to be pretty when your hair
hangs in straggling locks, your too plump figure festoons
itself around you in bags, and your clothes look
as though you had never had them off since you first
became acquainted with them. Poor things, they lead
an awful life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you speak to her, Clara,&#8221; Hard said, with a
smile. &#8220;I think your Spanish is in better working
order than mine. Ask after the daughter&#8217;s husband;
he&#8217;s in the army and it may open the way for a little
information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Conrad spoke in rapid and soft-sounding Spanish
to the old woman who stood listening, her wrinkled
face set in the monotony of hopelessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;How beautifully she speaks Spanish!&#8221; thought
Polly, enviously. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand a word of it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
but even I can tell the difference between hers and the
kind that both the men speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, my friend.&#8221; Clara&#8217;s voice was
cheerful and pleasant. &#8220;How is the family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Badly, señora, very badly. My son Manuel joined
the army last night and with him his wife and two little
ones. Now we have no man in the house&mdash;we shall
starve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your daughter&#8217;s husband?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Francisco was killed last week in a fight. The
soldiers brought the news. Carlotta has four little
ones now and no man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very bad. I am sorry. What soldiers do
you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night. The soldiers who came from the
north.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you mean that the crowd that was fighting up
here in the hills were soldiers?&#8221; broke in Scott,
eagerly. &#8220;Federal soldiers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, the soldiers of the revolution&mdash;Sonora
troops. They march south against Sinaloa.&#8221; Carlotta
had crept nearer and was taking part in the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you. Who was doing the fighting?&#8221;
demanded Scott.</p>
<p>The old woman burst into rapid speech, leaving Scott
in the lurch immediately. Clara came to his rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor old thing is more Indian than Mexican
and she doesn&#8217;t talk very clearly,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She
says that the party which came along the road last night
was a regiment of cavalry from up north. They saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
the barn burning and thought that the bandits were on
the march; so they started over that way. They fell
in with the stragglers of the Yaqui crowd and started
to fight. As near as I can tell, each party seems to
have thought that the other was Angel Gonzales&#8217; band.
The Yaquis had been rooted out of their village by
Gonzales and were on the warpath, poor creatures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately, there were a lot of Yaquis in the troop
and by the time the fellows who were trying to loot us
came along they began to understand the situation and
the lot of them joined the troops. This old lady&#8217;s son,
Manuel, joined too, and his wife and babies went
along. That explains why they let us alone last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;And it shows that Angel is
around somewhere bent on deviltry. Here, old lady, is
something to buy chow for the babies for a few days&mdash;better
luck to you!&#8221; He handed her some money and
they drove away amid loud thanks and happy smiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world do you mean by the wife and
babies going, too?&#8221; demanded Polly, excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, here in Mexico war is a family affair,&#8221; replied
Scott. &#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as the girl I left
behind me. The Missus goes along and so do the
youngsters. She does most of the foraging for food
on the march.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mexican believes in equality of the sexes,&#8221; said
Hard. &#8220;He believes that the woman has just as much
right to do manual labor, to provide a living for the
family, to fight, and to perform all the other unpleasant
functions of living as he has. If there are not enough
to go around, he generously allows her to do his share.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to be a wife in Mexico,&#8221; observed Scott,
drily. &#8220;Think of that, Miss Polly, next time you meet
a fascinating Spaniard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be disagreeable,&#8221; said Mrs. Conrad, &#8220;and
don&#8217;t tell fibs. It&#8217;s the women of the lower classes
who have the hard time down here just as they do in
every country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except the U. S. A.,&#8221; replied Scott, stoutly. &#8220;A
woman may have hard luck in our country because
she&#8217;s sick or poor or married to a no-account; but not
because the general opinion of the female sex is so
darned low that any loafer who comes along feels that
he&#8217;s got a right to treat her as he pleases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How you like to argue every point, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
observed Polly. &#8220;Were you born like that or did it
grow on you? Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;oh&#8221; was literally jolted out of her. Turning
rather a sudden curve at a pretty good clip, the wagon
slipped over the edge of a chuck-hole a little deeper
than the ordinary. Happening as it did in just the
right place, it caught the weakened wheel and
wrenched it off as neatly and as suddenly as a dentist
wrenches a tooth out of the jaw of an unwilling patient.</p>
<p>There was a crash and a jar as the wagon sank on its
side, and the frightened horses struggling to pull the
dragging load, snapped the harness where Scott had
patched it. The occupants were jumbled into the bottom
of the wagon, except Hard, who was pitched out
into the road. Scott was out in a minute and at the
horses&#8217; heads; the women righted themselves just in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
time to see Hard pull himself to his feet, staggering as
he did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt, Henry?&#8221; asked Scott, who was trying to
calm the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, just bent my knee under me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, hold these critturs while I pull the ladies
out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all right&mdash;that is, I&#8217;m all right. Look after
Mrs. Conrad,&#8221; said Polly, as Scott lifted her from the
débris. &#8220;What was it? The wheel?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Conrad gladly availed herself of Scott&#8217;s ready
arm. &#8220;What did Henry do?&#8221; she said. By this time,
Scott was loosing the horses from the harness and
Hard had hobbled over to the edge of the road, where
he sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my bad knee,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I did this once,
only much worse, playing football in college. Fell,
you know, with it doubled under me. I was laid up
for six months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Henry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shan&#8217;t be this time. It always lames me for
a few hours, though, when I do anything to it. Knees
are great chaps for bearing malice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly shan&#8217;t walk to Athens,&#8221; said
Polly, with decision. &#8220;You must ride one horse and
Mrs. Conrad the other, while Mr. Scott and I walk.
I&#8217;d love to!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child, you couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Clara.
&#8220;Could you ride, Henry, do you think? You and
Polly could ride to Athens and send somebody back for
us with the other wagon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could,&#8221; said Hard, &#8220;but I&#8217;d rather not. I&#8217;d like
to rest it for a couple of hours if I could. Scott, suppose
you walk and let them ride and leave me here.
There&#8217;s a shady-looking spot over in those cottonwoods
and I&#8217;ll just rest there till I&#8217;m able to hobble back to the
Soria place. You can send for me there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a trail just above here that goes over and
strikes the one we came on about eight miles from
Athens,&#8221; said Scott, doubtfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never traveled
it, but Gomez told me about it last year. Rough, he
said, but navigable. I guess that&#8217;s what we&#8217;d better do,
Hard, leave you here and I&#8217;ll walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is it?&#8221; asked Mrs. Conrad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, twenty miles, maybe. It cuts off a good deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t walk twenty miles on a rough trail, my
dear man, if I can prevent it,&#8221; said Clara, firmly.
&#8220;You and Polly must ride, and I&#8217;ll stay here with
Henry. Now, please! I&#8217;m at home in this country
and I&#8217;m not afraid.&#8221; There was a pause, then Scott
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess she&#8217;s right, Hard. They don&#8217;t either of
&#8217;em ride well enough to tackle a strange trail alone,
and if I walk it will delay sending back for you. One
of us had better ride the trail with Polly, while the
other stays at Soria&#8217;s with Mrs. Conrad.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a little more discussion it was decided that
Scott and Polly should go, while the other two returned,
after Hard had rested a bit, to the Soria place.
Scott moved the suitcases which Clara had brought
over to the little nook made by the cottonwoods, where
they could be left until someone came with the Athens
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
wagon, and helped Hard to hobble over there. Then,
feeling rather as though they had deserted their
friends, and yet not knowing what else to do, Scott and
Polly rode away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>In after years, Scott was wont to say that he distrusted
the trail recommended by Gomez from the moment
his horse started to travel it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one of those trails that didn&#8217;t look right&mdash;from
the first,&#8221; he would say with a reminiscent inflection.
As a matter of fact, however, the trail looked
innocent enough at the first glance, and Scott&#8217;s pessimism
may be laid partly to the circumstances under
which the trip was attempted and partly to the fact
that Scott almost always hated to change his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it be, do you suppose, before you
can send back for the others?&#8221; queried Polly, as
they rode away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we ought to make Athens to-night,&#8221; replied
Scott, thoughtfully. &#8220;Tom could start back with our
wagon early in the morning. Cochise and this fellow
I&#8217;m riding, Jasper, could make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to stay at the Sorias&#8217; all night.
They&#8217;ll be very uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re neither of them tenderfeet.
They&#8217;ll get along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be very romantic, of course, and very exciting,&#8221;
sighed Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Romantic? Why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, people have a way of making love to
widows,&#8221; said Polly, wistfully. &#8220;And anybody with
half an eye can see that he likes her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! Hard&#8217;s a gentleman; he won&#8217;t think he
has to be rude to a woman just because he&#8217;s left alone
with her overnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t being rude to ask a woman to marry you if
you happen to like her, is it?&#8221; demanded Polly, with
spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, under some circumstances,&#8221; replied Scott,
shortly. &#8220;You&#8217;re pretty romantic, aren&#8217;t you, for a
grown-up girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Not at all.&#8221; Polly flushed, indignantly. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m interested when I see two people that I like falling
nicely in love with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not in love with him or she&#8217;d have married
him when she had the chance,&#8221; said Scott, authoritatively.
&#8220;She&#8217;s an ambitious woman; what does she
want of a man buried in a coal mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She may have changed. That was a long time
ago,&#8221; ventured the girl. &#8220;And if she cares for him,
she might forget her ambition. Women do, sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in books they do,&#8221; replied Scott, moodily.
&#8220;But I never saw a woman in her class give up anything
she really wanted just to marry a poor man. If
she did, she&#8217;d probably make him miserable afterward,
when she was sorry she&#8217;d done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode a while in silence. Polly was hurt and
angry. It occurred to her that Scott&#8217;s objection to her
romantic imaginings was based on something deeper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
than just his usual argumentativeness. Perhaps her
imagination had misled her in regard to what had been
in his eyes the night before. Or rather, not her imagination,
but her vanity. It was a disagreeable
thought for one who had promised herself to have done
forever with that unpleasant trait. Also, down underneath,
there was a hurt that had nothing to do with
vanity.</p>
<p>Scott rode silently, occupied with his thoughts. He
glanced now and then, however, at the slender figure
of the girl who rode beside him. She was very pleasing
to look upon, with her curly, reddish hair, big dark
eyes, delicate features, and smooth tanned skin. Her
white hat was pulled down to shade her eyes; her
brown coat, trousers and boots wore a jaunty appearance;
but it was not altogether of appearances that
Scott was thinking.</p>
<p>It is possible with some of us to view the outward
and the inward at the same time and to render quite
unrelated verdicts. Scott had been conscious of doing
this before with Polly Street, but of late somehow the
verdicts had begun to agree. He was finding the inward
Polly quite as attractive as the outward. Had
she changed or had he learned to look deeper, he wondered?
He had thought her spoiled and superficial,
yet possessing undoubtedly worth-while qualities, such
as pluck and honesty&mdash;things you cannot be deceived
in.</p>
<p>Now he was finding another side to the girl; a something
very sweet and lovable. Was he being led away
by the eye of man which is troubled by many things, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
was the better side of the girl coming to the surface under
different conditions? Was she beginning to care
a little for him or was she playing with him as she
probably had done with the Henderson boy? Scott set
his teeth grimly.</p>
<p>There are after all two great classes into which humanity
may be divided; those who are living purposefully,
in the higher sense of the word, and those who
are drifting. The purposeful people may and often do
go wrong, but they have at least something to come
back to when they right themselves. The drifters, on
the other hand, are not only without help for themselves,
but have a dreadful way of clutching at the
purposeful ones and submerging them as well. The
average man or woman who belongs to the former
class has rather a horror of the drifter and likes to
give him a wide berth. Something of this nature had
passed through Scott&#8217;s head more than once when he
had been attracted by a woman whose outer and inner
trappings did not correspond.</p>
<p>It was so easy, however, to like this auburn-headed
youngster, who seemed to have gotten over her anger
against him and to be beginning to like him. She had
such a warm, quick smile; such a caressing look in
those serious eyes. She was so natural and easy with
him; turned to him so quickly for his approval of what
she said or did and took his uncouth criticism so
sweetly. It was flattering&mdash;yes, that was just the
point. Was she sincere, or was she planning to add
him to the list of her victims? She would not do that.
He was no boy, to be petted and thrown aside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>About this time, they came upon the trail. The little
river had followed the road for about a mile and a half,
when across on its other bank Scott saw a deep rut
leading out of it and continuing in a narrow line or
trail so faint as to be easily overlooked. It wound
along, lost itself in some chaparral and doubtless became
clear again beyond. The chaparral being on a
little rise, one could not see beyond it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There we are,&#8221; he called to the girl, who had fallen
a little behind. &#8220;Wait a bit till I find a place to get
down the bank on this side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly waited. Scott rode up and down the bank;
finally he stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to cross here,&#8221; he called. &#8220;It&#8217;s steep
but it&#8217;s all right. Follow me,&#8221; and both he and his
horse disappeared in the river bed. Polly rode up and
took a look at the descent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go so far as to say that he picked a nasty
one because he&#8217;s out of temper, but it looks like it,&#8221;
she grumbled. &#8220;Go on, pony, if he can do it I suppose
we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pony put her two forefeet over the edge of the
descent and clung to solidity and sanity with her hind
two.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do if I had four
legs and some fool tried to make me slide down a
precipice. But we&#8217;ve got to go. That man&#8217;s got a
jaw like Napoleon and there&#8217;s no use arguing with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked down. Scott had reached the bottom
and was smiling back at her. One had to admit that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
he had the sort of smile which warmed up the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to come and lead her?&#8221; he offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not.&#8221; Polly gave her mount a little dig with
her heel, the tension on the hind legs relaxed, a series
of slides and jolts and the descent was made. She
found herself in the river with Scott while the horses
drank thirstily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the only place to come down,&#8221; he said, penitently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t scared, it was the horse,&#8221; replied
Polly, briefly. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t think that every time we
hang back it&#8217;s my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known times when it was a sign of good sense
to be scared,&#8221; retorted Scott, as he turned his horse&#8217;s
nose toward the upward climb.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man can use up more good gray matter trying
to dodge paying one a compliment than most men use
in thinking up one,&#8221; decided Polly.</p>
<p>The way through the chaparral was trying. The
trail was very faint, the stiff brush hit one in the face
and almost tore one&#8217;s clothing. It was necessary for
Scott to go first in order to keep the trail, while the
girl fell considerably into the rear to escape the blows
from the brush which flew back after he had disturbed
it. On either side of them, above the brush, rose
walls formed by foothills, growing higher as they went.
They were evidently going directly into the mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we crossed two ranges when we came
from Athens to Casa Grande,&#8221; reasoned Polly, &#8220;and
we&#8217;ve got to cross them again going back. But this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
doesn&#8217;t look as though we were going through any gaps
as we did on the other trail. We&#8217;re evidently going
straight up. It&#8217;s going to be hard on the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> hard on the horses. It was getting on in the
afternoon and the sun was still very hot. They had
seen no water since leaving the little river. The trail
had come out of the brush and become a narrow&mdash;a
very narrow ledge on the side of the mountain, while
on the other side one looked down into a ravine deep
enough to make one&#8217;s head swim if one looked too long.
Scott ploughed along ahead, looking back whenever the
trail showed a nasty place, ready to jump off and go
to the girl&#8217;s rescue if necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a plucky one all right,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;This is no trail for a tenderfoot. I hope we don&#8217;t
run into anything worse before we get through. How
are you coming?&#8221; he called back.</p>
<p>They had come to a turn in the trail. Huge boulders
poised on the edge of the narrow ledge with that utter
disregard for gravity displayed now and then by rocks
which look big enough to know better. Scott had dismounted
and stood looking into the ravine which had
widened into a valley. In front of him, on the narrow
turn, it seemed but a step to the tree-tops of the valley
below. Further ahead, lay the next range of mountains,
higher than the ones through which they were
passing. Back of them, the winding trail seemed to
flutter like a brown ribbon. Polly hopped down and
joined him. Together they drank in the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too lovely. It hurts,&#8221; said the girl, with wet
eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? I didn&#8217;t know myself that there was
anything around here like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth being raided for,&#8221; replied Polly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
stay here a while and keep on looking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott smiled. &#8220;Will it spoil it for you if I eat a
sandwich?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if there&#8217;s one for me, too,&#8221; laughed the
girl. &#8220;But I thought you left all the lunch with the
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all. I&#8217;m too good a woodsman to go on a
strange trail with nothing to eat in my saddle-bag.
Luckily I didn&#8217;t have to leave them the canteen.&#8221;
They ate the sandwiches&mdash;saving a portion for dinner
in case they were late reaching Athens&mdash;and washed
them down with warm water from the canteen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look around the corner before we mount
again,&#8221; suggested the girl. &#8220;I like to know what&#8217;s
ahead of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Around the corner&#8221; was a slope down into the
ravine, more gradual than before and green with
stunted grass and mesquite. Here and there a cactus
rose gauntly, some in the tall Spanish bayonet with its
lovely bloom, and some in the low, dagger-like plant
close to the ground. Above them, on the right side
rose the rocky wall of the mountain, not altogether
sheer in its ascent, but curving in and then out at the
top, the upper ridge forming a shelf. Mesquite grew
seemingly out of the solid rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, look,&#8221; exclaimed the girl. &#8220;There&#8217;s almost
a little cave up there under that shelf! It could be a
rustler&#8217;s cave if there were any rustlers around.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There are more rustlers than there are things to
rustle,&#8221; remarked her companion.</p>
<p>Standing on the narrow trail, they looked over and
down into the valley. It was lonely to look at; not a
house, not a living creature, and yet so very beautiful&mdash;with
a warmth of color and sunshine. Polly did not
speak. Her eyes were fixed on the scene below. She
did not see the look on Scott&#8217;s face as he stood beside
her, gazing not at the valley but at the purity of her
face so near his shoulder.</p>
<p>It was very still. Suddenly a bird flew from one
of the bushes, flew across the rock in front of their
faces. Polly, her thought broken, turned quickly and
surprised the hungry look in Scott&#8217;s eyes. Her face
flushed and neither spoke. Then, impulsively, he took
her in his arms and kissed her passionately, Polly, sobbing,
clinging to him in a silence full of meaning. As
suddenly Scott put her away from him, holding her
and looking into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221; he demanded almost angrily.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not playing with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly did not answer. She looked up into his eyes,
her own still wet. He took her in his arms again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why!&#8221; he said, softly. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing
about me for you to fall in love with. Are you
sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very sure,&#8221; she lifted her head. &#8220;I was sure last
night, when you nearly told me&mdash;before those Indians
came. Why didn&#8217;t you want to tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I knew I&#8217;d no business to,&#8221; replied Scott,
roughly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no business to, now, but I&#8217;m human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
and when you stood there with the sun on your hair,
and that look on your face, I fell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand that way again,&#8221; smiled Polly, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll
stop scowling and say nice things to me. It isn&#8217;t a
criminal offense, Marc Scott, for an unmarried man to
fall in love with me. Don&#8217;t feel so badly about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be criminal, but it&#8217;s not square,&#8221; replied
Scott, obstinately. &#8220;With you a rich man&#8217;s daughter,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not an heiress, remember! That makes a difference,&#8221;
she said, coaxingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;anyhow, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re not rich,&#8221; said
Scott, soberly. &#8220;I think I&#8217;d fight with a rich wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Marc, you and I would fight, no matter
who had the money. We&#8217;re the scrappy kind. But,
on the other hand, we&#8217;ll always make up again, and
that&#8217;s what counts. That&#8217;s what Joyce Henderson and
I couldn&#8217;t do. We went for months and months without
a quarrel, but when we once had one we couldn&#8217;t
get over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve forgotten about that chap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite. He doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again they were silent, the sun picking out radiant
bits of Polly&#8217;s hair to light upon as she stood leaning
against Scott&#8217;s arm, his rough coat rubbing her soft
skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice old world,&#8221; she said, drawing a long
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good enough for me,&#8221; he answered as he leaned
over and kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, I&#8217;ve been wondering for a week
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
whether it was me or Mrs. Van Zandt that you were
in love with?&#8221; said Polly, with one of her sudden
smiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Care for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Scott&#8217;s voice died away in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You behaved as though you did. You are always
so gentle and pleasant with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gentle and pleasant with everybody,&#8221; declared
Scott, stoutly. &#8220;I have that kind of disposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better go and get the horses,&#8221; suggested
Polly. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not begin disagreeing with
you just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott, chuckling, went back after the horses. Polly,
left alone, sat down on a stone and gave a little sigh
of contentment.</p>
<p>&#8220;To think,&#8221; she said, incredulously, &#8220;that once I
thought I was in love with Joyce Henderson!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly!&#8221; Scott&#8217;s voice was sharp. He came
around the turn on a trot. &#8220;Those cussed horses
have cleared out and left us high and dry. I&#8217;ve got to
go after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;I thought horses always went home when
they ran off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;ve gone down into the canyon&mdash;there
may be water down there. Will you sit here while I
go after them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; forlornly. &#8220;You won&#8217;t stay
long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be back in half an hour.&#8221; Scott disappeared down
the trail. Polly watched him a moment or two and
then returned to her resting place. Something of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
happiness was gone from her eyes. The accident was
ill-timed. It brought a feeling of foreboding most disagreeable
in its contrast with her former exaltation.
She jumped to her feet determined to do something to
take her mind off the ugly thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll climb up and see if that really is a cave up
there,&#8221; she thought. Fired by this ambition, she
started to work her way up the cliff; no easy task and
ruinous to riding boots of soft leather. By the time
she had discovered this last fact she had covered about
one-third of the distance and was crouching beside a
protruding rock to get her breath. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather foolish
to tear up a perfectly good pair of riding boots just at
the psychological moment when leather is villainously
high and I&#8217;m on the verge of marrying a poor man. I
guess I&#8217;ll give up the cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the view had been remarkable from the trail, it
was marvelous from the little eminence which she had
reached. She looked and looked, her eyes full of
wonder. Away in the distance, a tiny stream fluttered
its way over the brown side of the mountain, which
the sun seemed to polish until it shone; while on the
shadowed side, the pines took on a dark, heavy green,
both sombre and beautiful. Below her, on the trail&mdash;but
what was that? Coming over the top of a hilly
rise, a little way below, was a man on a horse&mdash;then a
second and a third, and finally a line of riders, so long
a line that it suggested a regiment!</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s mind worked quickly. There was but one
explanation; Angel Gonzales was in the neighborhood,
was on his way to rendezvous with Juan Pachuca, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
without doubt this was Angel Gonzales, and these
were his men. What should she do? They were coming
very rapidly, and whatever was done would have to
be done instantly. Her first thought was for Scott.
He would be taken unaware. If she could only get to
him&mdash;warn him&mdash;so that he could hide in the brush till
the men had passed! Breathlessly, she began to climb
down the cliff. She was badly frightened, her nerve
was shaken and her strength seemed to be leaving
her. She found herself slipping and sliding on the
rock.</p>
<p>Another look at the riders showed them very near&mdash;so
near that her courage failed her. In a panic she began
to climb again. She must reach the little cave before
they saw her. She could not fall into the hands
of Angel Gonzales. She caught her breath in little
sobs, her heart seemed about to burst, every foot gained
meant a desperate effort. She clutched at the tufts of
mesquite that grew out of the rock and thanked Providence
that her brown suit was so nearly the color of
the cliff. Gasping and sobbing, she finally sank behind
the mesquite bush which covered the cave.</p>
<p>It was not really a cave, she discovered, but merely
a crevice in the cliff, made into a little shelf by the
rock which protruded above it, while the bush growing
thickly in front of it gave it the look of a cave. It
was, however, a shelter, and Polly crouched in it
thankfully, breathing with difficulty and keeping one
eye on the line of men filing along below her. They
were a hard looking lot, clad in all sorts of clothes
from uniforms to overalls. They seemed to her inexperienced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
eye innumerable; they were, perhaps, seventy-five
or a hundred.</p>
<p>&#8220;And poor&mdash;like an army of tramps,&#8221; she thought.
&#8220;Very desperate tramps&mdash;oh, why didn&#8217;t I keep on
and try to warn Marc?&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not understand her panic, now that her
own danger was over and the men had passed. Marc
Scott had called her a brave girl, and she had saved her
own skin and let him walk into the trap. She sobbed
bitterly. If there was only anything that she could
do! To sit there in that awful silence was more than
she could bear. She could no longer see the riders,
who had turned the curve and were out of sight and
sound. Far off in the distance two buzzards circled
about over something that was dead or dying. Perhaps
it was a man&mdash;at the thought the girl rose unsteadily
to her feet. She could not stay alone another
moment in this horrible place; she would go and find
Scott, if she had to brave Angel Gonzales to do it.
With a recklessness born of desperation she slid and
scuffled down the side of the cliff and ran blindly down
the trail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>ANGEL</h3>
</div>

<p>Scott, starting breezily down the trail after the recreant
horses, whistled a tune as he went, for he was
happy. He did not weigh reason against happiness&mdash;it
was too soon for that. He would have given you,
however, if pressed, a number of very good reasons
why he and Polly Street were going to be happy together,
in spite of their different upbringing, and his
own not very lucid reasons for not having wanted to
marry her.</p>
<p>Just at present he was occupied with the idea of the
horses. He felt that they would not be apt to go back
on the trail unless it was to look for water, and water
they might find at the bottom of the ravine though the
underbrush was too dense for him to see it. He could
follow their trail very easily in the sandy path but he
walked a quarter of a mile before he found the place
where they had struck out of the trail for the bottom
of the ravine.</p>
<p>Very cautiously he started down, for the going was
decidedly bad and he had no wish to risk a fall. He
trailed the prints, marveling at the sure-footedness of
the animal which can follow so hazardous a path.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare put a horse down a trail like this,&#8221;
he mused with a grin, &#8220;and yet the rascals will go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
down by themselves as smooth as silk. Hullo, I
guessed right! There is water down here. There&#8217;s
old Jasper filling up on it, and the mare, too. Well,
I guess we don&#8217;t walk home this trip.&#8221; And just as
Polly, some hundreds of feet above him was trying
madly to reach the cave, Scott, quite oblivious of impending
danger, started on his difficult climb, leading
the two horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Serve you darn well right, you fellows, if I was to
make you haul me,&#8221; he said, as Jasper&#8217;s soft nose
rubbed against his shoulder. &#8220;I would, too, if I didn&#8217;t
think you&#8217;d slide down and break my neck just when
my girl needs me. Come on, you grafters, shake a
leg, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a bad climb. The perspiration rolled off
Scott&#8217;s face and the veins stood out upon his forehead.
Gasping for breath, he dug his toes into the soft earth
and plugged ahead, pulling the reluctant animals after
him. He had nearly gained the top, was within
twenty feet, perhaps, of the end of the climb, when
Jasper began to pull back. They were breaking
through some brush, Scott being nearly through when
Jasper began pulling. Scott gave the bridle an irritated
jerk and spoke sharply to the horse. As he did
so, he looked up and saw Angel Gonzales and his band
coming down the trail. For a second, Scott lost his
wits. He took a quick step forward, giving the bridle
another jerk as he did so. Jasper, naturally aggrieved,
pulled back again, and Scott, standing on a
loose bit of rock, slipped, tried to right himself, slipped
again, overbalanced, fell and rolled down&mdash;over boulders,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
through brush, falling ever faster as he tried to
regain a foothold.</p>
<p>Both bridles had been wrenched from his hand as he
fell and the horses, half scared, half inquisitive, followed
him a few steps and then returned to the
munching of grass, behind the clump of brush.</p>
<p>Angel Gonzales, a large, brutal-looking man, his face
covered with a black beard, his clothes bearing the
mark of many a scuffle, swung down the trail in the
lead, his particular crony, one Porfirio Cortes, riding
immediately after him. A little distance intervened
between Cortes and the other members of the party.
Even in bandit circles the line is drawn somewhere,
and in Angel&#8217;s band it was drawn immediately after
Porfirio Cortes.</p>
<p>Angel rode, one leg thrown over his pommel, which
enabled him to chat comfortably with Cortes. They
were talking of Juan Pachuca.</p>
<p>&#8220;A slippery one, that,&#8221; Cortes had remarked, keenly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he means to throw in his lot with us.
When I see him do it, I will believe&mdash;not before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? I have more men than he has. He
needs men. All he has is this understanding that he
brags of with the new government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lies, <i>amigo</i>, lies! His record with Carranza is
against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, all men lie,&#8221; replied Angel, tersely, and with
probably no intention of plagiarism. &#8220;Anyhow, we
can do some good fighting together. There will be
some fine pickings when we get the old man out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Mexico City. Think of the money, the fine clothes,
the women!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think of them,&#8221; replied Cortes, meditatively.
&#8220;But I think also of Obregon. I hate that man. He
hung a cousin of mine, once, for less than what you
and I did to those Yaquis. Also, he has persecuted
Villa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so will I persecute Villa if I ever get a
chance,&#8221; replied Angel, cheerfully. &#8220;The fat thief!
Think of the gold he has hidden in these mountains!
Hold&mdash;what is that? Down in the canyon? Horses!
Is it troops, do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Troops&mdash;in a hole like that? It might be those Indians&mdash;an
ambush!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be like the devils. I don&#8217;t see them
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw Soria&#8217;s burro, most likely. Your nerves
are bad, as the gringos say.&#8221; Both men grinned and
rode on. Suddenly, they heard a crashing sound of
scattering stones that rose even above the noise made
by their horses. Angel threw up his head in alarm,
very much as a horse does when he scents danger.
&#8220;It is the Indians,&#8221; he said to Porfirio. &#8220;We must
not be attacked in this narrow place. Forward! Ride!
The Yaquis are upon us!&#8221; he cried, driving the spurs
into his horse. He was followed by Cortes, who in
turn was followed by the others. The entire band
gave a vivid moving picture of a reckless run down a
narrow trail, by a hundred men, any one of whom
would have considered it utter madness had he been
alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>Marc Scott, stopped by a mesquite bush near the
bottom of the canyon, lay for a few moments where
he had fallen, literally too shaken to move. When he
realized what had happened to him, he crawled to his
feet and listened. All was still. The sounds from
above had ceased, and a cloud of dust hovering over
the trail was the only evidence that he had not imagined
the passing of a crowd of men.</p>
<p>&#8220;By golly, I believe they didn&#8217;t hear me after all!&#8221;
he gasped. Then the thought came to him of Polly&mdash;alone
on the trail above him. A sickening fear shook
him; how could she possibly have escaped those men?
In a blind fury he started to climb the ravine. It had
been hard going before&mdash;now, in spite of his body, stiff
and shaken, he did not feel the effort. His face was
purple with heat and exertion, his hands were bloody
with the cactus he had clutched when falling, but his
terror for the girl dwarfed all physical discomfort.
Panting and choking, he forged ahead. If he could
only reach Jasper he would follow that cloud of dust
until he knew what had happened to the woman he
loved.</p>
<p>Jasper and the mare, uninfluenced by motives either
of fear or anger, still grazed by the clump of brush
and allowed the almost exhausted Scott to lead them
back to the trail. He mounted Jasper, and turned the
mare loose. He started down the trail after the vanished
band at a pace quite as reckless as their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marc! Marc Scott!&#8221; Polly&#8217;s voice rose desperately
as she saw him disappearing down the trail.
&#8220;Come back here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>Scott turned, bewildered, to see Polly running wildly
toward him. She flung herself upon him and upon
Jasper before he could dismount, pouring out the story
of the men who had gone down the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the worst of it was,&#8221; she wept, stormily, &#8220;that
I didn&#8217;t even try to warn you. I just made for that
cave and hid myself. That&#8217;s the sort of a girl I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you, honey? Do you know, that strikes me as
mighty sensible? I don&#8217;t hold much with girls saving
men&#8217;s lives outside the movies, where they&#8217;re well
paid for it. It strikes me life-saving is a man-sized
job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re all scratched! What in the
world&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to roll down the hill to dodge &#8217;em,&#8221; chuckled
Scott, as he caught the mare and helped the girl to
mount her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you about it after a while; just
now I think we&#8217;d better be on our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode on in silence, back over the trail and
around the curve past the imitation cave which had
sheltered Polly. Scott eyed the horses with inward
pessimism.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re never going to make it,&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;They&#8217;re about all in now. Wish I knew whether to
camp out and go on in the morning or to keep on
pushing. If I was alone I&#8217;d bed down for the night
but I hate to ask her to spend a night in the open
unless I have to. Well, we&#8217;ll go on a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode on, the tired horses going more and more
slowly and responding less and less readily to urging.
The trail did not go all the way down into the canyon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
but met a rocky ledge which crossed it like a natural
bridge. It was narrow and it was slippery with loose
stones, but the girl took it silently. She was too tired
and hungry to be afraid. The two sandwiches seemed
things belonging to another life. She tried to smile
when Scott looked back at her but it was hard
work.</p>
<p>They came off the ledge onto the side of a hill which
formed a part of the second range of mountains. The
spot, green as a deer park, was directly on the side of
the hill, about half-way up. Around it were trees&mdash;pines
and live oaks. The trail seemed to have disappeared
altogether. Scott had dismounted and was
waiting for the girl to come up.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she demanded, anxiously.</p>
<p>He dropped his horse&#8217;s bridle and came to her side.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve a question for you, best girl,&#8221; he said, his hand
on the pommel of her saddle, &#8220;These horses are
hardly fit to climb this next range. They might do it
and make the rest of the trip to-day if we urged them
but it ain&#8217;t a square deal. Then, too, it would be dark
before we got there.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a place where we could stay. There&#8217;s pasture
for the horses and I think that little stream that
I found down in the canyon starts from up here somewhere.
If we go on we may make it and again we
may get tangled up in the mountains after dark, which
I don&#8217;t fancy. I&#8217;m no forest ranger, you know. Shall
we stay here till three or four o&#8217;clock in the morning
or shall we plug ahead? It&#8217;s up to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly turned an appalled face toward him. &#8220;But,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
Marc, you don&#8217;t mean to stay here&mdash;in this place&mdash;all
night?&#8221; she said, faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t be exactly all night. It&#8217;s nearly five
o&#8217;clock now and we could start at daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;why, we haven&#8217;t anything to stop with! No
tent and no blankets and nothing to eat! It would be
rather dreadful, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not dreadful, exactly. We&#8217;ve the blankets
under our saddles, and you have your long cloak. I&#8217;ll
build you a fire. Of course there&#8217;s nothing to eat except
the rest of the sandwiches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps&mdash;it would be pretty bad to get lost
up here after dark. There might be mountain lions or
mad skunks. They do have mad skunks out here,
don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott chuckled. &#8220;Search me, honey, all the
skunks I ever met were mad. Come on down and
we&#8217;ll have a look at the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marc,&#8221; Polly looked down at him, her eyes soft,
&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering what I would have done if those
bandits had gobbled you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t let bandits gobble me when I&#8217;m escorting
ladies,&#8221; replied Scott. Then meeting her eyes, the
twinkle faded out of his. &#8220;You&#8217;d better say what
would I have done if you hadn&#8217;t hidden in that cave.&#8221;
His head rested for a moment against her knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Seems as though things were being
managed for us, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted her to her feet and she looked around her
curiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty place,&#8221; she pronounced. &#8220;I hope
you&#8217;re right about the water. I saw a little stream
way up in the mountains when I climbed to the cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to let Jasper find it for me,&#8221; replied
Scott. He had the saddles off the tired horses in a
few seconds and they lay down and rolled happily,
drying their sweaty backs in the dust. When they got
to their feet again, he took the two long ropes from
the saddles and fastened them around the horses&#8217;
necks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to tie them up?&#8221; demanded the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now. Going to let them drag the ropes
around. I can catch &#8217;em easy that way. Guess
they&#8217;re too tired to go far.&#8221;</p>
<p>The horses had smelled the water and made for it.
It ran in a trickling little stream down the hillside about
a dozen feet away, hidden by some brush. Once refreshed,
they were easily led back and began to feed
on the coarse grass. Scott shook out the blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a bit horsey,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but they&#8217;ll
keep you warm. I put them under the saddles instead
of the regular saddle blankets because I&#8217;ve been caught
out this way before. A man learns things in this country.&#8221;
He handed Polly her long coat and she slipped
into it. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t exactly the time of year I&#8217;d pick
for a camping trip,&#8221; he added, &#8220;but we&#8217;ll do, I reckon.
Do you want to eat the sandwiches now, or do you prefer
dinner at six?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly eyed the two big sandwiches with a serious
eye. &#8220;Let&#8217;s look at them a while first,&#8221; she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
hungrily. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there any way of getting anything
else? Can&#8217;t you shoot something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything but you and me and the
horses. What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; For the girl had given
a shriek of joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my coat pocket! A cake of chocolate that Mrs.
Van put there&mdash;and the sugar. I always bring it for
the horses. We&#8217;ll keep the chocolate for breakfast,
shall we?&#8221;</p>
<p>They ate the sandwiches and topped off with the
sugar. &#8220;Which,&#8221; said Polly, seriously, &#8220;is very
strengthening. I&#8217;ve heard that they feed it to the
Japanese army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard that, too,&#8221; assented Scott, &#8220;but I
reckon that&#8217;s not all they feed &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not all you&#8217;ve been fed, either, so don&#8217;t
grumble,&#8221; said the lady, practically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Scott, rising, &#8220;that before it grows
dark I&#8217;ll investigate this trail a bit. It looks sort of
blind to me. If we have to start by moonlight
it&#8217;ll be just as well to have some notion of where to
begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly leaned back against a tree and watched him
lazily. He looked very strong and capable. She recalled
Joyce Henderson&#8217;s graceful proportions and
smiled. She had had to come a long way to find the
man she wanted but she was well content. It was odd,
she reflected, that she and Joyce Henderson, who had
known each other all their lives, were like strangers
once they attempted the more intimate relation; while
for this man whom she had known but a few weeks she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
felt a sense of familiarity, of belongingness, that she
could scarcely believe. She was trusting him now in
a way that she had never imagined herself trusting any
man and yet she felt at ease.</p>
<p>Scott, returning, threw himself down beside her.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve found the trail,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but we&#8217;ve got some
traveling ahead of us. Don&#8217;t look to me as if anybody&#8217;d
been over it since Gomez was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t those men come this way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. They must have hit the trail lower down&mdash;from
some place we&#8217;ve missed. I&#8217;ll swear no crowd
like that have been where I&#8217;ve just been.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him gravely. &#8220;Do you think we
ought to go back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back? No, I don&#8217;t. Those folks are waiting for
us at Soria&#8217;s and I want to get Tom started for them
as soon as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if those men will make any trouble at
Soria&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe so. If it was Angel Gonzales, he&#8217;s
heading for your gentleman friend&#8217;s place and he&#8217;ll be
in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you go on calling him my gentleman
friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you think he&#8217;s some kind of a guy, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; demanded Scott, with a grin. &#8220;Pretty manners,
soft voice, nice long eyelashes&mdash;all that kind of
thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; replied Polly, stoutly. &#8220;I like Juan
Pachuca and I believe he&#8217;s been led away by bad
company. I believe what he told me about that treasure,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
too. I only wish I&#8217;d made him tell me the name
of the border town where it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women are queer,&#8221; remarked Scott, with more
truth than originality. &#8220;Well, Polly Street, I think
I&#8217;ll gather the wood for your fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they gathered the loose twigs and branches&mdash;they
were not many, but eked out with pine cones
would make a fire for a few hours, and Scott made
Polly&#8217;s bed close by it. He put his rubber poncho on
the ground and made the girl wrap herself in both
blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a heavy sweater under my coat,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll have to keep moving a good deal to look
after the horses and keep the fire going.&#8221; And he refused
to take a blanket, much to Polly&#8217;s dismay.
&#8220;Curl up and be comfortable, girlie, and relax. It
don&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t sleep if you can relax.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly tried to comply, but she was too much interested
in what was going on around her to give up
either to sleep or to relaxation. The crackling of the
fire and its wonderful odor, the little hushing noises
of the birds going to rest, the gentle coming up of the
moon and the myriads of stars, all were too fascinating
to risk missing in sleep. Scott had gone after the
horses and had tethered each by a long rope in a place
where feeding could be attended to, and had come back
to the fire and thrown on some more wood. He sat
smoking with his feet nearly in the fire and his face lit
by its glow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve spent lots of glorious nights in
the open?&#8221; asked Polly, wistfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A good many. Some of them not so glorious,
either. One night up in New Mexico&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused
to light another cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; demanded the girl. &#8220;When you say &#8216;one
night up in New Mexico&#8217; I feel just as I used to when
my father used to say &#8216;once upon a time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know why I happened to think of this
special night,&#8221; grinned Scott, &#8220;except that on most of
my out-of-door nights I&#8217;ve been by myself&mdash;out hunting
and that kind of thing&mdash;and this one I had somebody
with me. It was when I was mining in Colorado,
and some fellows I knew had a big cattle ranch down
in New Mexico. It was a real ranch&mdash;not a two for a
cent one like Herrick&#8217;s. I went down to visit them
at round-up time. I&#8217;d never seen a round-up before so
I was hanging around every chance I got.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had a lot of cattle&mdash;some of them pretty wild&mdash;and
it wasn&#8217;t easy to keep &#8217;em together especially at
night. Well, one day Jim Masters got a fall from his
horse and a kick on the head from another when he
was down, and he was in a pretty bad state&mdash;it looked
to us like concussion of the brain but we didn&#8217;t know.
We carried him into a tent we&#8217;d put up about a quarter
of a mile from where the cattle were, and one of the
boys rode to town for a doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were up on a mesa, like the one we crossed
yesterday, remember? We had outlaw cattle in the
bunch and it took all the boys to handle them. I,
being a tenderfoot and not much use with the cattle,
said I&#8217;d sit with Jim and sort of watch him till the
doctor came. He was out of his head so &#8217;twasn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
any comfort to him but it made the boys feel better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it was a comfort to him, Marc Scott! You
are the sort of person it would be a comfort to have
around if one was out of one&#8217;s head,&#8221; said Polly,
emphatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, honey; I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re jollying me.
Anyhow, I stayed with Jim and while he lay there
groaning I sat in the doorway of the tent and smoked&mdash;wasn&#8217;t
anything I could do for the poor boy. Man,
that was a night! The mesa just like a big green table
spread under the sky&mdash;what is it that lunger poet said&mdash;&#8216;under
the wide and starry sky&#8217;? Well, that&#8217;s how
she looked. Mountains all around, moon blazing away
showing up the cattle at the other end of the mesa,
not a sound except the river, one of those busy little
rivers that keep it up night and day. If I&#8217;d known
something of cattle I wouldn&#8217;t have thought that stillness
was so pretty, but I didn&#8217;t. I hadn&#8217;t even noticed
that the cows had stopped bellowing&mdash;it seemed like a
night that ought to be still.</p>
<p>&#8220;When, all of a sudden, I saw a movement in that
bunch of cattle. It was a stampede. That&#8217;s what
they&#8217;re cooking up, you know, when they&#8217;re still like
that. Before I&#8217;d realized what had happened they began
to bolt&mdash;and in our direction. It was just exactly
as if one of those old bulls had said to the crowd:
&#8216;There&#8217;s a couple of stiffs in a tent down by the river,
boys, let&#8217;s rush &#8217;em.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;They came down that mesa like all heck let loose.
The electricity in their hides had made a sort of blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
haze&mdash;phosphorescent, they call it&mdash;and it gave &#8217;em
an awful look. Of course, the boys hadn&#8217;t let them
start a stampede without doing anything to stop &#8217;em.
They were riding round &#8217;em, yelling and shooting into
the air, but on they came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was no place for me and Jim. It began
to look to me as if that doctor was going to have his
trip for nothing, but what could I do? I couldn&#8217;t go
off and leave Jim, and when I tried to pick him up he
fought me so I had to drop him. &#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t have
done much good anyhow because there was no place to
go. So I said to myself: &#8216;Sit tight, old man, and if
you can&#8217;t die game, die as game as you can.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;On they came like a lot of mad things. Then, all
at once, when I&#8217;d about given up hope, the boys got
&#8217;em to milling. You know how they do that? Get &#8217;em
started to going round and round instead of straight
ahead and the fools will go till they drop in their
tracks. When I saw &#8217;em doing that I knew that Jim
and I weren&#8217;t slated for Heaven that night so I sat
still and enjoyed the sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one wild sight. You can read about stampedes
till your head aches but you&#8217;ve got to see one
to know how she feels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What an interesting life you&#8217;ve had, Marc, and all
I&#8217;ve done was to drive a Red Cross ambulance around
Chicago and win a few golf trophies,&#8221; murmured
Polly, sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that depends. Perhaps it&#8217;s been interesting,
but it ain&#8217;t been easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a while and then Scott saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
that the girl had fallen asleep. He smiled as he put
more wood on the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny that she and I should find each other out of
all the world,&#8221; he meditated. &#8220;Just one nice girl and
one no-account chap drawn toward each other. Some
folks call it Fate. I didn&#8217;t mean to do it and maybe
I&#8217;m going to wish I hadn&#8217;t&mdash;but just now I&#8217;m satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>TOM DOES A MARATHON</h3>
</div>

<p>That Jimmy Adams survived the operation of probing
to which he was subjected by Li Yow was to Tom
Johnson evidence of an almost miraculous skill on the
part of the Chinese doctor. Tom knew very little
of operations. His life had been a normal one and
the grisly sight which he was called upon to witness
would have altogether unmanned him had it not been
for Mrs. Van&#8217;s timely nip. As it was, he came out of
the room extremely depressed.</p>
<p>Depression was a mood which in Tom Johnson usually
led to action. In this case his first move was to
visit Cochise. It did not brighten his outlook upon
life. Cochise was in no state to travel, that was evident.
He was tired and stiff and his back showed signs
of soreness. Rest was undoubtedly what his case demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you was a society dame, your doctor would send
you to Miami for a month and say cut out all mental
strain,&#8221; soliloquized the engineer, bathing the back
gently. &#8220;Being as you&#8217;re a horse, the best we can do
is to turn you out to pasture for a while. Well, I&#8217;m
no fancy rider, God knows, but nobody can say I
ever give a horse a sore back. That blanket was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
pretty nigh off your tail when he brought you in. Any
white man would have stopped and fixed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sauntered back to his cabin and sat down to
think. Tom was tall, over six feet, and very thin.
His skin was brown and his straight black hair which
he wore rather long, not because he liked it, but because
he disliked the Conejo barber, gave him rather
an Indian look. His clothes hung loosely on him, lending
very little to his personal charm, and when he sat
he usually sat on his spine, a practice deplored by
beauty doctors. When O&#8217;Grady came along a few
minutes later, he was deep in thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what do you think of this here business over
at Casa Grande?&#8221; demanded the latter persistently.
&#8220;Think the Doc&#8217;s lyin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should he? Besides, he was scared. He
most put old Cochise out of commission. He saw
something all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think it was Pachuca?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Why should Pachuca come back after he&#8217;d
cleaned &#8217;em out once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaquis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be. And ag&#8217;in it might be the rebels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the rebels now? Johnny&#8217;s bunch?&#8221; asked
O&#8217;Grady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me. I suppose this here state of Sonora
is fighting the rest, but I don&#8217;t see that they&#8217;ve got any
call to burn an Englishman&#8217;s property. This here Mrs.
Conrad&#8217;s English, too, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she ain&#8217;t English, she&#8217;s good plain American,
Came from Boston, same as Hard,&#8221; said O&#8217;Grady.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t an American woman lose her nationality
when she marries a foreigner?&#8221; demanded Tom,
wisely.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d ought to if she marries an Englishman,&#8221; replied
O&#8217;Grady, belligerently. &#8220;But don&#8217;t she get it
back if he dies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hanged if I know! Woman&#8217;s suffrage has come
up since I left home,&#8221; replied Johnson, placidly.
&#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;m going to walk to Conejo and see if I
can&#8217;t find out something about Casa Grande.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk? Holy Moses! I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t. Somebody&#8217;s got to stay here and
look after Mrs. Van and Jimmy. The Doc can&#8217;t fight
and Williams don&#8217;t think of anything but the store.
You and Miller have got to do the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go to Casa Grande? It&#8217;s nearer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use? What could I do? If I go to
Conejo, I can pick up Mendoza and his car and mebbe
some fellers to go along and make a posse. Of course,
if they&#8217;re cleaned out&mdash;but I&#8217;m figurin&#8217; that they ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. You got to do that,&#8221; replied O&#8217;Grady.
&#8220;When you goin&#8217; to start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon as I can get Mrs. Van to put me up some
chow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good luck to you&mdash;and the rest of them. I&#8217;d
sure hate to think of them folks of ours massacred
by a bunch of greasers,&#8221; and O&#8217;Grady strolled sadly
away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Zandt was washing dishes when Johnson
stopped in with his request He prefaced it with an
inquiry about the invalid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s doin&#8217; all right, I guess. Doc&#8217;s give him
something to make him sleep. I&#8217;ll say this for the man&mdash;he&#8217;s
a good doctor. He means to be a doctor while
he&#8217;s here, too. Nothing doing on the cooking job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir! I asked him something just kind of
casual about pies and you&#8217;d have said he&#8217;d never heard
of one. Distant as anything! I suppose I can stand it
if he cures Jimmy. Where you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to walk to Conejo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom repeated his plan. Mrs. Van wiped her eyes on
the dish towel. &#8220;You&#8217;re a good man,&#8221; she said, simply.
&#8220;I wish I could go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t feeling as brisk as I&#8217;m letting on about this
business, Mrs. Van,&#8221; continued Tom. &#8220;What that
Chink saw don&#8217;t listen good to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor to me. When I think of those girls&mdash;well, I
ain&#8217;t going to think of them. After all, Tom, there&#8217;s
more ways for folks to get out of trouble than there is
for them to get in. I&#8217;ve always noticed that. When I
was married, I had a husband who knew more about
getting into trouble than any living man, and I used to
notice that he always went about it in just the same
kind of ways&mdash;drink, cards, and women; but when I
had to get him out of it&mdash;why, Lord, there were a million
different ways I had to manage. There are loads
of ways for smart folks to dodge trouble and our folks
are smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson started for Conejo about noon. It was not
the hour he would have selected for a long walk in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
warm climate, but he had no choice. He did not try to
make very rapid progress during the afternoon, his
idea being to get in his best work at night; so he rested
whenever he struck a shady spot. A stranger coming
along and spying Tom stretched under a tree, with his
sombrero covering his face, would not have associated
him with reckless speed. He ate his supper slowly,
thanking Heaven for the invention of the thermos bottle,
and then started for the long pull.</p>
<p>It was cool and delightful now and he felt refreshed
and invigorated. His bundle was light and he swung
along at a good clip. In and out of arroyos, over little
bridges, under fragrant branches of pine&mdash;the walk
was pleasant and the engineer reflected that one sees a
good deal from one&#8217;s feet that one misses from the cab
of an engine. Prairie dogs scuttled into their holes as
he approached and chipmunks sat on branches and
swore at him in sharp little voices. Now and then a
far-away but penetrating odor reminded him of another
night animal on the prowl.</p>
<p>His wisdom in following the railroad track instead
of the road was evident. It was longer but it led
through the mountains at the lowest places. Midnight
found him nearly out of the mountains, standing, tired
but not exhausted, on the edge of a decline, looking
over miles of the semi-flat country to a dark spot where
one or two lights twinkled faintly and which he knew
was Conejo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Swartz is still on the job,&#8221; he reflected, as he
rolled himself in his blanket and settled down for a
nap. He had built a small fire and lay with his feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
almost in it. He stared ahead of him over the road
which he must travel before he could reach his destination
and though his trip was only half made he felt as
though he were already there, so encouraging was the
sight of Swartz&#8217; night light.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great country for them that can stand the
pace,&#8221; he murmured, sleepily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion sometimes
to go back to Omaha and get me a wife and settle
down out here. Picking a woman these days is a risk,
though. Get a young one, so&#8217;s you can educate her,
and ten to one you get an ambitious young brat that
wants to spend all your money seein&#8217; life. Pick a settled
one, a widow woman, say, and you get one that
knows more&#8217;n you do and that don&#8217;t make for happiness
in married life. Mrs. Van Zandt&#8217;s a likely woman
but she&#8217;s had one gold brick&mdash;&#8217;tain&#8217;t likely she&#8217;d want
to fall for another. Besides, I can enjoy her cooking
and her company without bein&#8217; married to her, and
there&#8217;s times I like right well to get clear of her gab,&#8221;
and so he drifted into sleep, snoring comfortably before
his fire went out.</p>
<p>It was the middle of the afternoon when Johnson,
tall, gaunt and tired, stalked into Swartz&#8217; store at Conejo
where he found a situation for which he was not
prepared. Conejo was under martial law, and from
every doorway he saw the interested faces of women
and children who stared at the soldiers as they went
by or stood talking in groups. The jail had a military
guard while the office of the local <i>jefe</i> swarmed with
uniforms. Outside stood a motor truck and two large
automobiles, quite dwarfing Mendoza&#8217;s Ford, which,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
having been requisitioned, also stood near by, its
wrathful owner lurking in the distance keeping an eye
on his treasure.</p>
<p>In Swartz&#8217; store the fat owner was still in his accustomed
seat, while the usual loafers still persistently
loafed, but there were soldiers everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew, this is something new for Conejo!&#8221; whistled
Tom. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;d better have a word with
Dutch before I horn in. Say, Swartz,&#8221; he said, pushing
a crowd of youngsters out of the way, &#8220;got
anything to drink? I&#8217;ve just walked in from
Athens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Gott, are you mad?&#8221; inquired Swartz, pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, but I&#8217;m likely to be if I don&#8217;t get something
down my gullet. Got any beer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beer?&#8221; Swartz&#8217; contempt was sweeping. &#8220;Look
at dem,&#8221; pointing to the soldiers. &#8220;Doos that look like
I haf any beer mit dem fellers around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are they? Federals or Rebs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;De State troops. Don&#8217;t you know dis here state
has&mdash;what you call it&mdash;seceded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martial law, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Swartz nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they grab your stuff or did they pay for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dey pays&mdash;in paper money,&#8221; replied the German,
sourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re better off than we are. They took
our stuff, shot two of the boys, knifed another, and
blew up our track.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who done it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Young Pachuca and his crowd. Say, who&#8217;s the
boss of this outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Swartz opined that Colonel d&#8217;Anguerra, who was
lodged in the house of the local <i>jefe</i>, was in command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-natured kind of a guy, is he?&#8221; queried Tom,
anxiously. &#8220;Or one of the kind that orders out the
firing squad if his dinner don&#8217;t set well on him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Swartz had seen better natured men than the
Colonel, but on the other hand admitted that he had
seen worse. &#8220;He iss a young man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and he
ain&#8217;t got so much sense that it bothers him, yet he tries
to keep them devils quiet if he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, give me a drink of water if you ain&#8217;t got no
beer. I guess I&#8217;ll look this feller up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got some lemon pop,&#8221; offered Swartz, hospitably.
&#8220;Them fellers don&#8217;t like it; it ain&#8217;t got poison enough
in it for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson, having drunk the pop, departed for the official
residence. It took some time and a good deal of
diplomacy to get an audience with the military chief,
but it was accomplished at last. D&#8217;Anguerra was a
youngish man, tall, thin and sallow. He spoke very
little English, but his secretary spoke it very well and
acted as interpreter, Tom&#8217;s Spanish being several degrees
worse than the Colonel&#8217;s English. The conversation
in two tongues proceeded through the secretary
with dispatch and accuracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that you are from an American mining
company located at Athens?&#8221; the Colonel began.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied Tom, a little awed by the other&#8217;s
dignity and the threefold nature of the dialogue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have been raided by bandits, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you&#8217;d call it that. Juan Pachuca
helped himself to what he wanted and shot two of our
boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they ain&#8217;t killed, but one of &#8217;em&#8217;s likely to lose
a leg. He knifed one, but the knife was dull and he
ain&#8217;t hurt much. But that ain&#8217;t what I come over here
about.&#8221; And Tom went on with Li Yow&#8217;s story of the
Casa Grande raid, the arrival of Scott, Hard and Polly,
and the fire. &#8220;I dunno and he dunno who done the
burnin&#8217; or what else has happened over there, but he
says they heard Pachuca say somethin&#8217; about meeting
Angel Gonzales, and I guess you know who he is. I
thought mebbe you could let me have a car and a posse
and I could go over and see what&#8217;s been done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel and his secretary conversed together
for a few moments, Tom listening anxiously but quite
unable to get the thread of the talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Colonel,&#8221; he continued, anxiously, &#8220;I
dunno if this little revolution of yours is going to turn
out the real thing or not; but there&#8217;s one thing you can
be darn sure of if it does, and that is that one of the
first letters your new president&#8217;s going to get in his
official mail is going to be a bill of damages from
Washington and whatever&#8217;s happened to our folks is
going to be wrote down in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel d&#8217;Anguerra smiled patiently. &#8220;I will tell
you, señor, what I know about the affair at Casa
Grande. According to this dispatch, a regiment of
Sonora troops passed by the ranch on their way south.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
They saw flames and heard shots. A band of Yaquis
who had been driven from their village by one Angel
Gonzales were burning and looting. The troops&#8217; orders
were for haste and they did not stop to find out
the extent of the damage but called off the Yaquis.
You perhaps know that those Indians are excellent soldiers
and that there are many of them in our army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to say they didn&#8217;t go over to see if anything
had happened to the women folks?&#8221; demanded
Tom, aghast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their orders were positive. They could not take
the time. To-day we have news that some of our
troops have crossed the Sinaloa border. These men
who passed Casa Grande were on their way to Hermosillo
to guard the capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it does look like you were pulling it off, don&#8217;t
it?&#8221; Tom&#8217;s voice was admiring in spite of himself.
&#8220;What beats me, señor, is how you manage to pump
enough enthusiasm into these fellers to keep them
fighting. You&#8217;ve been at it nearly ten years now. In
my country we&#8217;d either have put it through by that
time or given it up as a bad job and pretended we&#8217;d
never wanted it anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican laughed. &#8220;My friend,&#8221; he said, seriously,
&#8220;people will fight for more than ten years with
the hope of liberty and a good government ahead of
them. This time we hope to get both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you do. It&#8217;s too good a country to go
to the dogs. But about this Juan Pachuca&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is no business of mine,&#8221; replied the Colonel,
briefly. &#8220;He was out of favor with the Carranza government
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
and evidently hopes to get into the saddle
again through the revolution. Personally, I do not believe
he will. General Obregon is not fond of his type.
Angel Gonzales is what you call in your country a
regular bad lot. I have orders in this dispatch to look
into his case. As to the automobile. I can give you an
order for the car which you saw outside&mdash;the small
one. I can&#8217;t spare any men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mendoza&#8217;s Ford?&#8221; groaned Tom. &#8220;I knew I&#8217;d
draw that. Well, never mind, señor. I&#8217;m obliged to
you just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The order written, Mendoza was induced to start.
&#8220;What the devil are those for?&#8221; demanded Johnson,
as he saw the old Mexican putting three large cans in
the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water,&#8221; replied Mendoza, tersely. &#8220;Las&#8217; time I
drive him ze radiator he leak. I mend him, but <i>quien
sabe</i>? We play safe, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, yes,&#8221; murmured Tom. &#8220;Come on,
<i>amigo</i>, it&#8217;s near six and this here&#8217;s no country to be
rattlin&#8217; round in a damaged Ford after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little car justified its owner&#8217;s faith in it, however,
for it went along at a good clip. The road from
Conejo was fairly good and they made good time. The
sun was down and the evening had set when they
reached the place where Scott and Polly had taken the
trail. Mendoza stopped the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of men been by here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Soldiers or
bandits&mdash;mebbe bot&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean?&#8221; demanded Tom, waking up.
&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217; have to be Injun to know dat. See tracks,&#8221;
grunted Mendoza. &#8220;Mebbe hundred men come here
from trail, <i>amigo</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom looked. The banks of the river were broken
and trodden by the feet of many horses. Even in the
dim light he could see that, though he would never
have noticed it for himself. He admitted when Mendoza
persisted that it did look as though a large party
of horsemen had crossed the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve passed anyhow, so we should worry.
Got a gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si</i>,&#8221; grinned Mendoza, cheerfully, &#8220;I always got a
gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, what&#8217;s this?&#8221; They had come around
the corner and saw, by the edge of the road, the
wrecked wagon. &#8220;That&#8217;s Herrick&#8217;s wagon,&#8221; said Tom,
excitedly. &#8220;In the ditch!&#8221; He got down and went
to investigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wheel&#8217;s busted. Horses must have got scared and
bolted round the curve,&#8221; said the engineer, meditatively.
&#8220;Nothin&#8217; in the wagon. Looks bad to me;
don&#8217;t it to you, Mendoza?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si</i>,&#8221; responded Mendoza. &#8220;We go by Soria&#8217;s
place. He know mebbe what happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Tom, sadly. &#8220;If they&#8217;d got
away on the horses seems to me we&#8217;d have seen or
heard somethin&#8217; of them on the road. Unless they
went by the trail&mdash;in that case them fellers on horseback
would have met &#8217;em. Well, step on your gas,
Mendoza, and let&#8217;s get to Soria&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soria&#8217;s place was empty. Not a child, nor a dog,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
nor a burro. Not a sign of life on the place anywhere.
This was a blow and intensified Tom&#8217;s gloomy fears.
He did not speak as they drove on to Casa Grande.
The moon was coming up and they saw the badly
burned ruins of the barn as they turned in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ze house is lef&#8217;,&#8221; said Mendoza, consolingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;But look at them windows!
Riddled with bullets. The boys must have put
up a good fight with them Indians, anyhow. Tell you
what, Mendoza, I&#8217;d give a good deal to see old Scotty&#8217;s
ugly mug in one of &#8217;em! Come on, we may as well go
in,&#8221; and he stepped apprehensively out of the car.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>AT SORIA&#8217;S</h3>
</div>

<p>Hard and Mrs. Conrad stared at each other in whimsical
dismay as the other couple rode away. Then they
looked at the suitcases carefully tucked away in the
brush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much of a hiding place,&#8221; observed Hard, &#8220;but
it&#8217;s better than leaving them in the wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And decidedly better than carrying them all the
way to Soria&#8217;s,&#8221; replied Clara. &#8220;Safe enough, too.
It isn&#8217;t once in a coon&#8217;s age that anybody travels
around these places. Funny, isn&#8217;t it, when you think
of all the crowded spots there are in the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It reminds me,&#8221; said Hard, with a reminiscent
chuckle, &#8220;of a yarn. I was in New Mexico on a hunting
trip with Joe McArthur&mdash;you remember the Boston
McArthurs who had a ranch near one of the Apache
reservations? Well, we rode up to the agency store to
ask old Slade, the trader, about an Indian guide.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got him and started out the next day. We
were riding up among the pines&mdash;great tall fellows, a
regular park of them; not a living thing in sight except
the birds, not a sound except the river. McArthur and
I were riding behind Charley, the guide. We&#8217;d been
arguing rather aimlessly as to whether an Indian had
a sense of humor or not; Joe thought they hadn&#8217;t,
while I contended that they had.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The quiet of the place rather got us. McArthur
took a silver dollar from his pocket and said: &#8216;Hard,
I believe I could lay this dollar on that stump over
there and come back here in a year and find it there.&#8217;
Old Charley turned around, his wrinkled face twisted
into a grin. &#8216;No,&#8217; he said, &#8216;no find him nex&#8217; year.
Mr. Slade he get him nex&#8217; morning.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Charley got the dollar and McArthur admitted
that I had the right of the argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds to me just like a McArthur of Boston,&#8221;
said Clara, severely. &#8220;An Indian without a sense
of humor! Just because they don&#8217;t see fit to howl over
the fool things a white man howls over, I suppose.&#8221;
She did not speak again for some time, then she burst
out tempestuously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry, why did you begin talking about Boston?
Do you know, I&#8217;ve been more lonesome for the dear old
place in the last twenty-four hours than ever before?
I wonder if seeing you has made me homesick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Hard. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for you to go
back to Boston, Clara.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps; but I shall come back here. Once this
country gets on its feet I can sell for a decent price.
There&#8217;s going to be a rush to Mexico some day when
people find that they can come without risking their
lives and their money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that time is coming soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it is. This last move looks hopeful. If
Obregon can establish a good government, he will. Of
course, our people will have to be patient. At any rate,
I&#8217;m going to risk it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; smiled Hard, &#8220;you would feel that way, of
course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money getting isn&#8217;t such an ugly business, Henry,
when you risk something. It puts a bit of romance
into the thing. I think I rather despise people who
make money just by sitting in an office and guessing
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clara, how old are you? Sixteen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind telling you that I&#8217;m older than I look,
and it&#8217;s a wonder to me after the hard knocks I&#8217;ve
had. Well, do you think you can hobble back to
Soria&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s wait a little longer. I could wish it a little
cooler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d wear a sombrero instead of that white
thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not built for a sombrero. Makes me
look like the villain in a show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara burst into laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what an absurd world this is
once a human being cuts loose from his original moorings!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? It&#8217;s an almighty hot world when he cuts
loose from a roof and an ice-water tank, I&#8217;ve noticed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking of ordinary things&mdash;I&#8217;m thinking
of you and me and Boston,&#8221; pursued Clara, firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clara, I can stand a good deal, especially from you,
but if you insist upon talking about Boston I&#8217;m likely to
do something that we&#8217;ll both regret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just thinking that if you and I had stayed in
Boston, in our own little niches, as our kind of people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
usually do, what would we be doing?&#8221; went on Clara,
meditatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be having a gin fizz at the club,&#8221; said
Hard, pensively, &#8220;to be followed possibly by a game of
bridge and a dinner&mdash;a real, human dinner, not just
food&mdash;at my brother John&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had stayed where I belonged, or where everybody
said I belonged when my father died and the
family income disappeared,&#8221; said Clara, persistently,
&#8220;I would be teaching music in a girls&#8217; school, and
planning a trip to Italy with a lot of other middle-aged
spinsters. Instead of that, I put all that I had into a
two years&#8217; study in London and Paris and fell in with
a wandering Englishman, married him, and here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t stay where you belonged,
Clara, for quite apart from the pleasure of your company,
which under sane conditions I find very delightful,
I don&#8217;t seem to see you in the rôle of a middle-aged
spinster. Still, you might easily have been one. I
know some charming girls in Boston who have gone
that path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; soberly. &#8220;Some of them so much more
charming than some of my married friends that I don&#8217;t
quite get the idea. Some of Nature&#8217;s blunders, I suppose.
Well, shall we start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better. I think it&#8217;s going to be some walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>They plodded along in silence. This time Hard
broke it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clara, do you think that youngster is good enough
for Marc Scott? You&#8217;re clever enough to judge people
even on a short acquaintance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, Henry, what a question!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit it&#8217;s crude. Theoretically, any nice girl
confers a tremendous favor on the man she marries
merely by so doing; man being inherently vile. But,
Clara, honestly, man to man, how many nice girls one
knows who would be the deuce to live with!&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;Henry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&#8217;re
perfectly right, of course, but man to man, do you
think you&#8217;ve any right to assume that the ones who
aren&#8217;t nice are any pleasanter&mdash;taken as a steady
diet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no, if you put it like that. But, I mean&mdash;well&mdash;this
Polly youngster, of whom by the way I am
very fond, I don&#8217;t know why, she&#8217;s as spoiled as the
deuce, has had very little education&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She graduated from Wellesley, so she tells
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly? How well they cover it up these days!
In my youth, you knew when a woman was well educated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And avoided her. That&#8217;s why they learned to
cover it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be trivial. What I mean is this. Scott is
an unusual fellow. He&#8217;s brought himself up from
nothing, with only a boost here and there from someone
who recognized his worth. He&#8217;s rough and he&#8217;s
odd, but he has a mind. He will always be a man of
importance in his community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit all that; but it doesn&#8217;t imply that he&#8217;s too
good for Polly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but after all, what does a spoiled society girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
of twenty-four know about a worth-while man, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear Henry, wake up! You aren&#8217;t living
in the Victorian period. She knows a lot more about
everything than you think, and well for her that she
does. Girls of to-day may be daring, they may be
over confident, they may be hard, but at least they
know something of the world outside their own environment.
After all, life&#8217;s a tricky job for a woman&mdash;don&#8217;t
begrudge her a little folly before she undertakes
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. I like frivolous girls&mdash;in a way; but I
don&#8217;t like to see a man with a brain marrying a kitten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly Street isn&#8217;t a kitten. She&#8217;s never had to consider
anything more serious than a golf course, but
she&#8217;ll make good when the time comes. She&#8217;s shown
that since she&#8217;s been here. But, Henry, why this sudden
interest in match-making? Has he, by any chance,
asked your valuable advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Match-making, you know, belongs to middle age.
Young people are too self-centred to bother with it. I
wonder if we&#8217;re nearly there? I&#8217;m dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my aching feet tell me we are, Clara, but my
manly intelligence suggests that if we&#8217;ve covered one-third
of the distance we&#8217;re mighty lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about what I thought,&#8221; groaned Clara.
&#8220;How&#8217;s your knee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peevish but possible. Shall we take a rest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear, yes, and a bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>They topped the next rise. It was decidedly a rise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
and commanded a wide view of the flat part of the
country. At a little distance rose a live oak whose low
branches offered a slight shelter from the sun. A
cooling breeze played about them, kicking up spirals
of sand, and a prairie-dog village manifested eager interest
in their presence. They ate their sandwiches
and Hard returned to the subject of Scott and Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think&mdash;you being a woman and acute in
such matters&mdash;that he&#8217;s asked her yet?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t; they both look too edgy. He&#8217;s going
to, however, and she&#8217;s going to take him, I think. I&#8217;m
not sure. She may be flirting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she flirts with Scott, I&#8217;ll have her punished,&#8221;
declared Hard, indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe she won&#8217;t. She&#8217;s a bit of a minx,
though, and while she&#8217;s young she&#8217;s no infant. Some
girls have to do the world&#8217;s flirting, Henry, because the
others won&#8217;t&mdash;or can&#8217;t. It wouldn&#8217;t do to have things
made too easy for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not,&#8221; said Hard, with meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this isn&#8217;t getting to Soria&#8217;s.&#8221; Clara rose
hastily. She looked back over the road. &#8220;It looks
like people back there&mdash;dust flying. Do you suppose
it&#8217;s more troops?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard stared. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, finally, &#8220;it&#8217;s only the
wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess it is,&#8221; assented Clara. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be
moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was slow going&mdash;a lame man and a tired woman&mdash;both
unused to walking even under favorable circumstances.
It seemed to Clara Conrad as she looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
ahead at the wearisome stretch of road, as though they
made no more progress than a couple of ants crawling
up a mountainside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we&#8217;ll ever make it?&#8221; she said, stopping
for a long breath at the top of a small rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; said Hard, simply, &#8220;What else is
there to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara did not answer but looked longingly back toward
the spot in the cottonwoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t play Lot&#8217;s wife, Clara; keep on looking forward.
It&#8217;s our only hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lot&#8217;s wife always appealed to my sympathies,&#8221; said
Clara, pensively. &#8220;I think she was probably a settled
sort of a woman, married to one of these men who like
change. It must have irritated her awfully to have to
pack up and move when she was so comfortable. Oh,
Henry, that&#8217;s not wind blowing the dust! It&#8217;s men&mdash;horsemen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does look like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming this way. I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I.&#8221; Hard&#8217;s voice was anxious. &#8220;If
we had a bit of shelter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked anxiously about, but the flatness of the
country offered no opportunity for anything larger
than a gopher to hide. Trees and bushes, alike too
small for shelter, and little rises of land, hard enough
to climb but easily visible to anyone on horseback, were
all that offered themselves. In the distance an arroyo
looked promising, but it was far and the line of riders
very near.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to make a break for it, anyhow,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
Hard, at last. &#8220;It&#8217;s off the road. It&#8217;s our only
chance; that, and the possibility that they may be
troops and in too much of a hurry to stop for the likes
of us. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara sighed and quickened her pace. They left
the road and struck across country toward the arroyo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re troops,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There
aren&#8217;t enough of them. Oh, Henry, suppose it&#8217;s Angel
Gonzales and his men!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;They may very
well be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll hope they&#8217;re not. Let&#8217;s
be optimistic as long as we have a straw to clutch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara did not answer. She took another look at the
rapidly advancing line and felt, not unreasonably, that
the straw was a weak one even for the clutch of an
optimist. They dug in, weary as they were, making
small progress, but with hopeful eyes bent upon the
distant arroyo. At least they were going in a different
direction from the riders. Hard limped painfully.
His face was set in lines of determination&mdash;or was it
pain? Clara wondered. She stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry,&#8221; she said, firmly, &#8220;this is folly. Those
men must have seen us. They&#8217;re able to overtake us if
they want to, and if they want to do anything to us,
they will. We can&#8217;t help ourselves. I&#8217;m not going
another step. I&#8217;m going to sit down here and see what
happens.&#8221; As she spoke, she sat down on a tree stump.
Hard laughed ruefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
got us, if they want us. We&#8217;ll hope they don&#8217;t.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
sat down on the ground beside her, feeling very much
as though he would never get up again.</p>
<p>So far the horsemen had given no indication of having
seen the fugitives. They were fox-trotting along,
in twos and threes, for the road was fairly wide.
There was no air of discipline about the party, nothing
to indicate that it was of a military character. As they
came opposite the fugitives, who had struck off the
road at a right angle, they stopped, in obedience to a
signal from one of the two riding ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve seen us!&#8221; breathed Clara.</p>
<p>&#8220;And are wondering whether we&#8217;re worth while,&#8221;
supplemented Hard. &#8220;Ah, here they come!&#8221;</p>
<p>The result of the conference reached, the two leaders
of the party followed by half a dozen men struck off
toward Clara and Hard. The others waited in the
road. They came at a good gait, their badly fed horses
responding to the ugly spur with a nervous speed which
covered the hilly space in seconds where Hard and
Clara had taken minutes to crawl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;re not troops,&#8221; observed Hard.
&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t take all that trouble for a pair of
strangers. It&#8217;s Angel, or someone of his sort. Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Clara smiled bravely. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing
to do but wait. Better let me talk to them; I have the
language better in hand, I think. If it&#8217;s money they
want we may as well give them what we have to buy
our freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means.&#8221; Hard grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got ten dollars.
It won&#8217;t buy much&mdash;even of freedom, I&#8217;m
afraid.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Most of mine is in express checks, tucked away in
a sheltered spot,&#8221; said Clara, frowning. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
they&#8217;d want them&mdash;Pachuca didn&#8217;t. However, I
have a little to offer.&#8221; She handed him her handbag.</p>
<p>Angel Gonzales, closely followed by Porfirio Cortes,
drew up beside the odd-looking couple sitting by the
wayside. The other men lingered within hearing.
Angel opened the conversation in his native tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you and where are you going?&#8221; he demanded,
his shifty black eyes gleaming from his
weather-beaten face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221; growled Cortes. &#8220;When the country
is upset, the place for foreigners is at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we know it is,&#8221; said Clara, placatingly. &#8220;But
your country, you know, is almost always upset. This
gentleman, Señor Hard, is connected with the mining
company at Athens. I am from the South, and on my
way to the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are your horses?&#8221; said Angel, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;A young man named Juan Pachuca raided the
ranch where we were visiting and took all the livestock,&#8221;
replied Clara, eyeing the swarthy fellow quietly.</p>
<p>There was a hurried colloquy between the two Mexicans
and a laugh from Gonzales.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going toward Athens,&#8221; he observed,
drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;re not,&#8221; replied Hard. &#8220;We&#8217;re heading
for the Soria place just at present with the idea of borrowing
their burro to ride and tie.&#8221; He had risen and
was leaning heavily on his well leg.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! It is a long walk to the Soria place,&#8221;
grunted Angel. &#8220;You&#8217;re lame?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, temporarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; Angel turned to his men. &#8220;Here, two
of you double up and give these people horses,&#8221; he
commanded curtly. Apparently, he was one of those
leaders whose word is law, for two of the men rolled
their horses and led them toward the two Americans
who stared at them in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go by Soria&#8217;s,&#8221; said Angel, gruffly. &#8220;We will
take you that far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, but I think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Clara began weakly,
but stopped as she felt herself being seized by one of
the men and lifted roughly to the saddle of a wiry little
gray horse which was dancing around in a most disconcerting
manner. It was a time for self-preservation
and not for protest. She grasped the pommel desperately
with one hand and the reins with the other,
while her feet were being thrust into the straps
of the stirrups&mdash;the stirrups themselves being too
long.</p>
<p>She was badly scared, for the horse gave every indication
of being unmanageable; and very miserable, for
her skirt pulled in a most uncomfortable and unsightly
fashion. There was nothing to do, however, but to
make the best of it; for having helped her mount, the
man who did so climbed up back of one of his fellows
and abandoned her to her fate. Hard, in the meantime,
had mounted another rough-looking but more
conventionally disposed beast, and the procession
started back to the road, the two Americans side by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
side, surrounded by the Mexicans; Angel Gonzales
leading, and Porfirio Cortes bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be a friendly lift, but it looks more like a
case of abduction,&#8221; said Hard, wrathfully. &#8220;Can you
hold that brute, Clara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; she said, her lips a bit white. &#8220;I think
the poor thing is as scared as I am; probably never saw
skirts before in his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to hold him too tight. He&#8217;s probably got
a tender mouth, judging from the way he fidgets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose he has, but if I don&#8217;t hold him, he&#8217;s
going to land me over somewhere in those foothills,&#8221;
said Clara, faintly. &#8220;He&#8217;s got the most awful little
rack I ever rode. Henry, do you suppose that fellow
is Angel Gonzales?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say. He&#8217;s an ugly-looking ruffian whoever
he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, here he comes! He may understand English,&#8221;
shivered Clara.</p>
<p>Angel grinned as he came back to them. &#8220;The
señorita does not ride very well,&#8221; he said, mockingly.
Clara did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she reflected, with a gleam of humor,
&#8220;that I ought to be grateful to be taken for a &#8216;señorita,&#8217;
but how can I be grateful for anything when I&#8217;m
being rattled to pieces?&#8221;</p>
<p>Angel joined himself to them and they rode three
abreast. He began to ask questions; questions which
plainly were designed to inform him as to the financial
standing of his guests or his prisoners whichever he
chose to make them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as persistent as a society reporter,&#8221; growled
Hard, under his breath, as Angel relinquished his place
to one of his men and fell back to ride with Cortes.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of ransom, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we make a break for it?&#8221; whispered Clara.
&#8220;If I let this thing go he&#8217;ll be over in the foothills before
you can whistle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;d shoot. Better not risk it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Henry, I can&#8217;t stand it! And I look so! I
never was so altogether wretched in all my life,&#8221;
groaned Clara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be patient, that&#8217;s a good girl, until we see what
they&#8217;re going to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that devil&#8217;s face is any index to his character,
he&#8217;s going to do something awful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angel Gonzales, in fact, was justifying Clara&#8217;s
opinion of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman has money and property, and so, I
think, has he,&#8221; he said to Cortes. &#8220;If they have
money, they have friends, and friends will pay, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; admitted Cortes. &#8220;But we are in a
hurry, <i>amigo</i>. If Pachuca has come this far, he means
business. We had better be on our way to meet him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s so. Our horses are not strong enough
to carry double, either. We&#8217;ll leave the Americanos
with Manuel Soria and pay him to keep them for a few
days until we know what we want to do with them,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad,&#8221; agreed Cortes. &#8220;Manuel is a good deal
of a fool but his woman is smart. Give her a gun and
she will know how to use it. She will do it for me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
because I make love to her now and then,&#8221; he added,
with something which in a civilized being would pass
for a simper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph, she&#8217;d do it for me because I&#8217;ll pay her
some good money and promise her more,&#8221; said the unsympathetic
Gonzales.</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the Soria cabin, much
to Clara&#8217;s relief, and the party dismounted. The cabin
door was closed, and Angel, who evidently wasted no
time on the little courtesies of life, raised his pistol and
fired into it. Clara caught her breath in horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those babies!&#8221; she gasped, clutching Hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re in there,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see a sign of life&mdash;not even the burro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry, they&#8217;ve gone to town to spend the money
that Mr. Scott gave them this morning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. They&#8217;ve taken the burro along to bring
home the supplies. Don&#8217;t say anything; let them find
it out. It&#8217;s not our funeral.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was soon apparent that the Soria family had gone&mdash;root
and branch. There was no response either to
Angel&#8217;s rude salutation or to the search which followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in a hole,&#8221; chuckled Hard, shrewdly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you a dollar that they meant to leave us here
and pay the Sorias to hold us. Now, they&#8217;ve either
got to take us along or leave a guard for us, which is
what they&#8217;ll probably do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any chance of his letting
us go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he look like a chap who lets anything get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
away from him? Well, I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s worried, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angel Gonzales was worried, no mistake about that.
The Sorias had upset his plans exceedingly. He did
not want to burden himself with prisoners; his horses,
fed only on the scant growth of the land, were in no
condition to carry double. He did not want to leave
any of his men behind, because he expected to need
every one of them in his proposed campaign. On the
other hand, he hated to give up the dazzling prospect
of a ransom. He had never played the ransom game,
but he knew the ropes and he longed to try.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that coming up the road?&#8221; demanded Cortes,
breaking off a dialogue with his chief.</p>
<p>A man&mdash;or, as it developed at closer range&mdash;a boy,
a very ragged boy, riding a sweating horse, was tearing
madly in their direction. Boylike, he pulled his poor
beast to its haunches and gave what was intended for a
military salute as he saw the redoubtable Gonzales.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter? Who are you?&#8221; demanded
that gentleman, unencouragingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Juan Pachuca&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; gasped the panting messenger,
&#8220;he sends me to say to Captain Gonzales to
make speed. He waits&mdash;at his <i>rancho</i>. He has news
of the revolution,&#8221; finished the boy, proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;News! Humph, is that all he&#8217;s got?&#8221; demanded
Angel, promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men, and horses and plunder&mdash;oh, much plunder!&#8221;
The boy&#8217;s eyes shone.</p>
<p>&#8220;So? That&#8217;s better, eh, Cortes? Shall we go,
or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Pachuca says to make speed. Much speed,&#8221;
reiterated the messenger. &#8220;The troops went South
only last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had better go,&#8221; said Cortes, eagerly. &#8220;We
can make the <i>rancho</i> with hard riding by morning.
That is, unless you burden yourself with those!&#8221; he
gestured scornfully toward the two Americans.</p>
<p>Angel hesitated. Like Scott, he hated changing his
mind. Also, the ransom loomed large; and he liked
the woman&#8217;s looks&mdash;liked her manner of talk. With
her dark hair and eyes, and her soft voice, she was like
one of his own people&mdash;&mdash;only much more charming, he
reflected, with a gleam of the eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Pachuca says&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil with Señor Pachuca!&#8221; exploded Angel,
menacingly. &#8220;Go back and tell him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But the
messenger had already gone. His horse&#8217;s feet were
pattering down the side of the hill at a rate which argued
panic in its rider. A laugh rose from the men,
and Angel, guffawing himself, sent a parting bullet
over the boy&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheerful man, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; muttered Hard. &#8220;Never
mind, Clara, he didn&#8217;t hit the boy. It&#8217;s evidently only
his little joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monster!&#8221; Clara&#8217;s black eyes snapped.</p>
<p>Apparently the little joke had cleared Angel&#8217;s mental
atmosphere, for without further explanation, he turned
and with a rough: &#8220;Get on your horses&mdash;we&#8217;ll go!&#8221;
swung onto his mount. Cortes, with a grin of relief,
passed the word on:</p>
<p>&#8220;To horse!&#8221; And in a second the party was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
mounted. Hard and Clara stood watching, ignorant
of what part they were to play in this new move. No
attempt was made to mount them, which was in itself
encouraging, nor did there seem to have been anyone
detailed to stay and guard them. There was another
confab between Gonzales and Cortes, which resulted in
the latter&#8217;s coming toward the two Americans and saying,
gruffly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Gonzales regrets that he cannot escort you
further but he is called suddenly to the front.&#8221; There
was a pause, then, with an impudent grin, he continued,
&#8220;Of course you know that in time of war, all alien
property is confiscate? You will give me what money
you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, give it to him, Henry, please!&#8221; Clara&#8217;s
voice was eager. She pressed her little handbag into
Cortes&#8217; willing hand. Hard shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, old man, it&#8217;s not much, and if I thought
you&#8217;d buy a good feed for those horses of yours, I&#8217;d
hand it over with my blessing. As it is&mdash;I hand it
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cortes took the money very much as a conductor collects
his fares&mdash;&mdash;with no comment but a ready hand.
He also took a diamond ring which Clara had thoughtlessly
put in the bag for safe keeping and the watch
which Hard carried. Then without further words, he
swung his horse around and at a command from
Gonzales, the whole crowd swept furiously down the
hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry, they&#8217;ve gone! Actually gone&mdash;and taken
that vile gray horse with them!&#8221; gasped Clara, faintly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like it,&#8221; responded Hard. &#8220;But unless
I&#8217;m a lot mistaken, they didn&#8217;t mean to go until that boy
came with his message.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, blessings on the head of Juan Pachuca who
sent him!&#8221; murmured Clara, wearily, as she started
for the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to stay outside or go in?&#8221; asked
Hard, pulling a chair forward on the veranda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Outside, please, as long as we can stand it,&#8221; said
Clara, with a little shiver. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d care
for Grandmother Soria&#8217;s housekeeping.&#8221; She peeped
into the family <i>olla</i> hanging on the side of the house.
It was full. &#8220;Oh, well, Henry, things might have
been worse,&#8221; she smiled as she sank into the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bet your dear life they might,&#8221; replied
Henry, with a glance in the direction taken by Angel
Gonzales.</p>
<p>&#8220;See if they&#8217;ve left anything to eat&mdash;anything that
looks fairly clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard emerged a few moments later empty-handed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We evidently arrived at
the psychological moment for this little family. That
ten dollars Scott gave them will tide them over till Carlotta
finds another beau.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But wasn&#8217;t there anything to eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bone. Mother Hubbard&#8217;s cupboard was a
cafeteria compared to Grandmother Soria&#8217;s. Draw in
your belt and forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did we eat so much this afternoon? They
left us the biggest part of the luncheon. Henry, we
are pigs,&#8221; moaned Clara, wanly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know. We&#8217;re not the sort to be cast on a desert
isle, I&#8217;m afraid. If the Sorias get back to-night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t. They&#8217;ll stay and make a night of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the hungry feeling will wear off after a
while,&#8221; said Hard, hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder? I&#8217;ve often thought I&#8217;d like to try a
fast. One hears of people doing it and having such
odd and fascinating sensations,&#8221; said Clara, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;My sensations are odd,&#8221; replied Hard, &#8220;but they
are distinctly not fascinating.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat quietly for a while, watching the clouds
hovering over the mountains, sometimes over the
peaks, sometimes nestling in fleecy patches half-way
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trail they took crosses about where that gap in
the mountains is,&#8221; said Clara. &#8220;Under that first cloud,
so Mr. Scott said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;ll have to do some climbing.&#8221; Clara
sighed softly. Hard felt an unreasonable desire, almost
an angry desire to take her in his arms. It was
a feeling unlike him, usually so moderate in his emotions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clara,&#8221; he said, softly, &#8220;were you thinking of him
when you sighed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara started. &#8220;Him!&#8221; she echoed, helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Dick Conrad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly, Henry. I was thinking of that terrible
trip we took through the mountains&mdash;yes, I was
in a way thinking of Dick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You were very happy together, weren&#8217;t you? You
were awfully in love with him, I mean. I&#8217;m not being
impertinent, am I, Clara? You know I don&#8217;t intend
to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Henry, I understand. I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m the
kind of woman who falls in love&mdash;at least, in the way
most people mean. There&#8217;s nothing very violent about
me except once in a while when I get to singing something
which takes hold of me pretty hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard and I had a rather exciting little love
affair, then after a while we both began to realize that
we weren&#8217;t very romantic&mdash;in regard to people. He
was passionately devoted to adventure of every kind,
and I had a way of putting my best into music. I
didn&#8217;t feel heart-broken when I found out that we
really weren&#8217;t anything more than good friends and
neither did he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d cheerfully give all I&#8217;ve got to bring Dick back;
I get lonesome for him&mdash;awfully. And yet, that isn&#8217;t
exactly the sort of thing that the average person means
by &#8216;love,&#8217; is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have made me very happy once to know
that you cared that much for me,&#8221; answered Hard,
bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. I always did, Henry. Only we were&mdash;so
near, so much a part of each other&mdash;like cousins. I
called it friendship instead of love,&#8221; cried Clara,
warmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What difference does it make what you call it?
Two people like to be together, seem to fit into one another&#8217;s
lives, isn&#8217;t that love?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>Clara smiled. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the kind of love that Polly
Street will give the man she marries,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
know that as well as I. And it&#8217;s not a matter of years,
it&#8217;s temperament. An actress told me once that when
it came to a question of comparison between her married
life and her stage life, she could say instantly that
it was her stage life that had meant the most to her.
She was happily married, too. I&#8217;m a bit like her. I
can get more downright exaltation over my music when
it goes right than I ever got out of any love affair. I
think my talent is for friendship rather than for love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clara,&#8221; Hard&#8217;s voice shook, &#8220;I tell you, you wrong
yourself. Neither you nor that woman were happily
married if&mdash;oh, I don&#8217;t want to be maudlin&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your heart, Henry, you couldn&#8217;t be, any more
than I could. Perhaps it&#8217;s the New England conscience&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a New England conscience,&#8221; replied
Hard. &#8220;My conscience is as elastic and pleasantly
disposed as an Irishman&#8217;s. Bunker Hill casts no blight
upon me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry, this is all very nice; but I&#8217;m dying of
hunger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be afraid to stay here if I go back to
Casa Grande and fetch you something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wild horses couldn&#8217;t hold me in this God-forsaken
spot without you, Henry! Don&#8217;t think of it. I&mdash;I&#8217;ll
go with you, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t walk it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll die on the road. But how about your
knee?&#8221; She stopped in discouragement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a knee or two when you&#8217;re starving to
death?&#8221; demanded Hard, with decision. &#8220;Come on,
let&#8217;s start before I get any stiffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>They started out again, through the half darkness;
walking slowly, for Hard limped painfully. He had
helped himself to a stout staff which he found on the
Soria veranda and which gave him some assistance.
They were very silent; Hard, because his mind was
still running on Clara&#8217;s words, Clara, because she was
honestly puzzled over the situation, and her own feelings.</p>
<p>She watched the tall, thin figure, limping along by
her side, and again the old memories came back, as they
had the night before in the darkness; memories of the
days when he and she had played at love.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t in love with him, and yet, seeing him
again, after all these years, it seems as though I must
have been,&#8221; she thought, gently. &#8220;It&#8217;s friendship, and
yet it&#8217;s more than friendship. It&#8217;s going to hurt dreadfully
to go away again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clara, one more word before we drop the subject;
because I will drop it if it troubles you.&#8221; Hard&#8217;s voice
came quietly through the darkness. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let us mistake
each other again. I&#8217;ve tortured myself for fifteen
years, wondering whether I should have let you go as
I did, or have tried to hold you. Do you think, with
fifteen years behind us, that we made a mistake?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara&#8217;s voice trembled as she answered: &#8220;No,
Henry, I don&#8217;t. We were too young to understand
each other. We needed experience&mdash;at least, I did. I
don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she added, with a shadow of a laugh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
&#8220;whether it&#8217;s the romantic situation, my enfeebled condition,
or your noble heroism, but I never felt more
like being in love with you than I do this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, Clara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, Henry. If you give out on the road I
shall try to emulate that husky woman in history who
carried her husband on her back, do you remember?&#8221;
Then, suddenly, her eyes filled with tears. &#8220;Henry,
you&#8217;ve been awfully patient with me. If you really
want to embark on the seas of matrimony with such a
shaky thing as I am&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clara, I never thought it would come about like
this or I would have smashed this cussed knee ages
ago! My dearest girl, my face is dirty and yours is
dirtier, but I&#8217;m going to kiss you, and then we&#8217;ll take
another whack at hobbling to Casa Grande.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranch-house stood dark and uninviting except
for the dim light of the fire which shone through the
broken windows of the living-room, but the sound of
the piano came to their ears as they neared it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s composing,&#8221; said Clara, softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he would be,&#8221; said Hard, unsympathetically.
&#8220;They always do work it off that way, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Work what off?&#8221; demanded Clara, instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything that happens to them,&#8221; said Hard, cheerfully.
&#8220;You artistic fellows are queer, you know,
Clara. Don&#8217;t try to wriggle out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Clara, promptly. &#8220;But let me
warn you, my lad, you haven&#8217;t made me want to give up
my music yet. I&#8217;m still going back to have a try at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for you! Of course you are. And I&#8217;m going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
with you, either to help you do it, or to make you
fall in love with me so deeply that you&#8217;ll want to give
it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara laughed softly and laid her hand on his arm.
&#8220;Henry, if you can do that, I&#8217;ll be the happiest woman
in the world. Please try!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>BACK TO ATHENS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mendoza and Tom walked toward the Casa Grande
ranch-house with fearful hearts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dark as a pocket,&#8221; commented Tom. &#8220;You set
down here, Mendoza, while I go around in back.&#8221;
From the side, a faint light was visible from the dining-room
of the house. &#8220;Hullo, what have we here?&#8221;
ejaculated the engineer. At the same time, he saw a
man&#8217;s figure coming toward him; a very familiar figure.
&#8220;Hard!&#8221; he gasped, darting forward and knocking the
load of firewood from Hard&#8217;s arms with the fervency
of his greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Tom!&#8221; Hard returned the handshake quite
as heartily. &#8220;Glad to see you. We were beginning
to think we were marooned on this place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; Tom&#8217;s face lit up. &#8220;You&#8217;re all right? All
of you? Didn&#8217;t none of you get killed by them
Yaquis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, didn&#8217;t Scott tell you?&#8221; demanded Hard, with
sudden anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t seen Scott sence you all went off together,&#8221;
said Tom, puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on! Do you mean to say that they haven&#8217;t
shown up yet? Scott and the girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I left Athens yestiddy morning. You see, I
walked to Conejo and picked up Mendoza and his car.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You walked to Conejo!&#8221; Hard&#8217;s voice was
awed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twa&#8217;n&#8217;t much. I took my time. You see, the
Chink brought us word that there was something going
on over here. He seen the barn burning when he was
up on the mesa, and he didn&#8217;t know what was up.
He pretty nigh killed Cochise, so I had to walk. I
knew there was no use coming here with no horses, so
I went to Conejo. They&#8217;ve got martial law there.
The Colonel&#8217;s a nice young feller, if he is a greaser,
and he loaned me Mendoza and the Ford. Now what
happened here, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard gave a brief outline of their adventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Conrad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is an old friend of Herrick&#8217;s
and mine, who&#8217;s had to leave her plantation in
the South, and is on her way home. She is going East
with Miss Street. She and I tried camping out at
Soria&#8217;s last night after Gonzales left us, but we got
starved out and we tramped it back here, waiting for
someone to come after us. I&#8217;m lame as I can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara&#8217;s face lit up when she saw the three men
enter, and she shook hands cordially with Johnson and
the old Mexican. Then an anxious look came into
her eyes. Hard, seeing it, spoke quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson left Athens yesterday before Scott and
Polly got there,&#8221; he said, reassuringly. &#8220;He walked
to Conejo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walked to Conejo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Tom, Mrs. Conrad and I walked here
from Soria&#8217;s and we&#8217;ve both been crippled ever since.
A walk to Conejo fills us with excited admiration.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>Tom chuckled. &#8220;Well, I always could walk,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;Never done anything particular with the
other end of me, but I could always depend on my
feet. Say, folks, Mendoza&#8217;s got his car outside. How
about a quick bite and then beating it for Athens?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara turned eagerly to Herrick.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come, won&#8217;t you, Victor? I hate to think of
your being here alone when everything is so upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herrick smiled and patted her hand affectionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will give me no peace until I do, so I will go,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was a sober little crowd that sat around the dining-room
table at Athens that night. Though their
joy had been very great at the safe coming of Hard
and Clara in Mendoza&#8217;s car, it had been tinged with
gloom at the non-arrival of Scott and Polly. Jimmy
Adams was reported much improved.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Chinaman doesn&#8217;t cook any more,&#8221; confided
Mrs. Van to Clara. &#8220;He&#8217;s had a rise in life and he
just sits and meditates. Awful people to meditate&mdash;the
Chinese. What they find to think about I can&#8217;t see,
but it seems to make &#8217;em happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clara&#8217;s mind, however, was upon the absent. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t see what could have happened to them. They
didn&#8217;t fall in with Angel Gonzales, that we know,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m dreadfully worried about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; It was O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Here comes
horses down the road&mdash;two of them. I believe it&#8217;s our
folks.&#8221; And he bolted out into the moonlight, followed
by the others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>It was, and a more exhausted and bedraggled couple
it would have been hard to find.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look like a pair of forty-niners,&#8221; said O&#8217;Grady,
&#8220;on the last lap of the trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott rolled out of the saddle while Hard lifted Polly
to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coffee!&#8221; whispered the girl. &#8220;Is it really coffee
that I smell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, I believe they&#8217;re starving,&#8221; gasped Mrs.
Van, running into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we&#8217;ve had to-day is a cake of chocolate and
some lumps of sugar,&#8221; said Scott, briefly. &#8220;Look
after the horses, O&#8217;Grady, will you? They&#8217;ve had it
pretty rough, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was lame and sore from his fall of the day before,
and tired and hungry from the day&#8217;s discomforts,
but he managed to say enough to give them an idea
of what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;After I climbed out of the arroyo,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know which way to go. If those fellows had
got Polly I wanted to go after them; if they hadn&#8217;t&mdash;well,
I didn&#8217;t dare take the chance that they hadn&#8217;t. I
was pelting down the trail like a madman when I
heard her voice calling me from up the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got on the horses and began climbing again,
pretty well pleased with our luck, but the horses were
all in. They&#8217;d been at it since early morning, climbing
most of the time, and I saw that they weren&#8217;t going
to make it. So I picked a good-looking spot near
the head of the stream that we&#8217;d been following, and
we camped there for the night, ate the rest of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
sandwiches, and rolled up in our blankets. It wasn&#8217;t
very comfortable but it was a case of needs must.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning I set out to find the trail again. It
had pretty well disappeared&mdash;choked up by the brush.
We fought our way through it all morning and finally
lost it; struck out higher up on the mountain and came
out on the barren side near the top. That&#8217;s all, except
that we&#8217;ve been going since five this morning on nothing
but a cake of chocolate that Polly found in her coat
pocket and a few lumps of sugar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were going back to Chicago to live I believe
I&#8217;d start soup kitchens for hungry people,&#8221; declared
Polly, suddenly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the worst thing in the world&mdash;being
hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Mrs. Van Zandt started suddenly
and stopped equally so. Polly blushed. Scott
came to the rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well tell &#8217;em while we&#8217;re telling
our other troubles,&#8221; he suggested, and Polly told
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home because he won&#8217;t marry me unless
Father consents,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and he doesn&#8217;t seem to
think a consent by wire is legal. But I&#8217;m coming
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wish you good luck, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221; Mrs. Van
Zandt leaned over and kissed Polly impulsively.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll browbeat you a bit but he&#8217;ll stick by you.
Guess I&#8217;ll make some more coffee,&#8221; and she bounced
into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious! Would you call that a congratulation?&#8221;
gasped Polly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a bona-fide one, my dear,&#8221; said Clara,
gently. &#8220;I am sure you&#8217;ll be happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others laughed and joked while Clara and Hard
kept their secret to themselves. Scott followed Mrs.
Van Zandt into the kitchen with some empty cups and
their voices could be heard talking earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the latter, as she returned, &#8220;I&#8217;ll say
I think Mr. Scott&#8217;s idea a good one.&#8221; By a psychological
process quite her own and quite unconsciously
followed, Mrs. Van had promoted Scott to the dignity
of the prefix upon hearing that he was engaged to the
superintendent&#8217;s sister. &#8220;He&#8217;s hired Mendoza and that
junk-pile of his to take you all to the border so&#8217;s you
can get a train East without traveling on the Mexican
railroads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like this,&#8221; Scott explained. &#8220;Tom says they
told him at Conejo that the revolutionary government
had taken over all the railroads, both Mexican and
American, and is operating them. Now, we might
make the trip all right&mdash;they say lots of refugees are
coming North; but what&#8217;s the use? I&#8217;ll run over to
Conejo and get them to let us keep Mendoza for a
few days and perhaps we can get some sort of a safe
conduct for the road from that military guy over there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have old Villa&#8217;s safe conduct than any
of the rest of them; I think it cuts more ice with the
population at large. But perhaps this chap can do
something for us. We&#8217;ll try to hit the border at Chula
Vista&mdash;the roads that way are pretty fair. Now,
Hard, suppose you and I take a turn down the road
and have a look at Jimmy before he goes to sleep.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Scotty,&#8221; they were outside and Hard spoke frankly,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to speak of it before the others, but
Mrs. Conrad and I have made up our minds to undo
an old mistake. We&#8217;ve going to try life together instead
of apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped you would, Hard. She&#8217;s a fine woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I say an old mistake, don&#8217;t misunderstand
me,&#8221; continued Hard, soberly. &#8220;She and Dick Conrad
were happy together. She loved him when she
married him&mdash;and she didn&#8217;t love me. The mistake
was mine, in not making her love me when I had the
chance. I&#8217;ve got the chance again and I&#8217;m going to
make good this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very lucky, Hard. Most fellows don&#8217;t get
a second chance&mdash;with the same woman. Will she
come back here with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;re going to be married in
Chula Vista and she&#8217;s going home just as she had
planned. I can&#8217;t go, of course, but as soon as Street
comes back I&#8217;ll either go to her or she&#8217;ll come to me.
She hasn&#8217;t given up her music and I don&#8217;t want her
to. It&#8217;s all rather hazy, Scott. I only know that I let
her get away from me once, and, selfish brute that I
am, I&#8217;m going to tie her to me now while she&#8217;s in the
humor.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>POLLY MAKES A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>Not far from the Mexican border lies the town of
Chula Vista, New Mexico. It is a small town, does
not even boast of a railroad connection nearer than
twenty-five or thirty miles, being, like Conejo, on a bi-weekly
spur; but it is a town of reputation and a not
altogether blameable civic pride.</p>
<p>It has borne its part in the border warfare with
credit. It has slaughtered and been slaughtered, one
might say, and rather enjoyed both proceedings.
When, some years ago, a Mexican bandit raided Chula
Vista and carried off a young woman, the citizens of
the town organized an expedition, followed him across
the line, and recovered the lady, none the worse for
her experience; which proves not only that Chula Vista
is a wide-awake town, but that some bandits are not
as black as they are painted.</p>
<p>Chula Vista, on the afternoon when our party entered
it, duly chaperoned by the aged Mendoza, presented
an everyday appearance. The Chula Vista
Trading Company was doing its usual business, and,
as this was before the days of prohibition, several saloons
were doing what they could to relieve a universal
thirst. An ambitious building of brick, the new
schoolhouse, witnessed the fact that culture was believed
in, even pursued.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>The other buildings were less imposing. There was
the butcher&#8217;s place, a small adobe with a fenced-in
yard. As Mendoza&#8217;s car drove past it, the butcher,
with sanguinary intentions, was occupied in driving a
wise and reluctant young steer around the yard. A
little further along was the Roman Catholic Church&mdash;a
Penitentes church, by the way, and the little house
of Father Silva, who officiated. Further still was a
long low building which had once been a livery stable,
but which had been altered to meet the needs of a moving
picture theatre, and the Commonwealth House,
kept by Sam Penhallow, who varied the monotony of
hotel keeping by exercising the duties of sheriff of the
county. He it was who had crossed the line after the
kidnapped young lady. The newspapers had featured
him as a Texas Ranger, which he was not and never
had been, but that was rather a near thing for a newspaper.</p>
<p>Penhallow was a tall, thin, brown-skinned man, who
wore checked suits and who had the long drooping
mustache which fiction assigns to the calling of a
sheriff. Whether fiction is right in this particular, or
whether Sam wore the mustache to conform with the
best standards, is not important. He was sitting in a
tilted chair, on the narrow strip of flooring which
served the hotel as a veranda when Mendoza and his
party wheezed into view.</p>
<p>Penhallow&#8217;s conventional welcome expanded into
real warmth when he recognized Scott, who was well
known in Chula Vista.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; he said, his hand outstretched. &#8220;If it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
ain&#8217;t Marc Scott! Drive you out down there, did
they? Well, Mendoza&mdash;blamed if I didn&#8217;t think you
was dead long ago! No, I don&#8217;t guess I know
the ladies or your other friend, but any friend of
Scott&#8217;s has got the keys of the city all right.&#8221; He
turned and called into the house: &#8220;Mabel, come out
here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these ladies, Miss Street, is on her way to
Chicago,&#8221; said Scott. Polly, restored to good looks by
a few days rest and her prettiest lace blouse, beamed
on Mr. Penhallow with the usual result. &#8220;Mrs. Conrad,&#8221;
continued Scott, &#8220;is a friend of ours and is going
back with the young lady. No, we weren&#8217;t driven
out but things are rather bad down yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you ladies sure have courage, travelin&#8217; round
at this time,&#8221; said the admiring Penhallow. A tall
pretty girl appeared in the doorway and was introduced
as &#8220;my daughter, Mabel, who runs the ranch.
Mabel, show these ladies the best rooms we&#8217;ve got.
Give &#8217;em the bridal soot if you can find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard, suitcases in hand, followed the women into
the hotel, while Mendoza steamed away to a haunt of
his own. Scott sank into an armchair and settled
himself for a talk with Penhallow.</p>
<p>&#8220;That young Street&#8217;s sister?&#8221; demanded the latter.</p>
<p>Scott nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard Bob Street had married a Douglas girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did.&#8221; Scott explained the situation in regard
to Polly. &#8220;Her people are anxious about her and wrote
her to come back at once, so we&#8217;re carrying out instructions.
The other folks&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Scott paused and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
surveyed the sheriff with an eye that twinkled. &#8220;Are
you good at keeping secrets, Sam?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have kept &#8217;em,&#8221; replied Sam, modestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the lady is a widow, runs a ranch down
South, and the tall chap is our chief engineer, a Boston
man. They&#8217;re up here to get spliced before she
goes East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So! Well, no reason why they shouldn&#8217;t, I
s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None that I know of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kind of had a hunch &#8217;twas her and you when
you got out of the car, Marc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You needn&#8217;t blush. You ain&#8217;t too old to
think of settlin&#8217; down if you pick a woman that ain&#8217;t
too young and giddy for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking your advice on matrimony, you old
fool, I&#8217;m asking if you&#8217;ve got anybody in this one-horse
place who can marry folks legally,&#8221; said Marc, touchily.</p>
<p>&#8220;The judge could, I guess, but in a case like this
there&#8217;d be more tone to it if you had the Padre. We
haven&#8217;t got any Protestant fellow here just now,&#8221; replied
Penhallow, meditatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Padre&#8217;s the boy. I&#8217;ll go over and interview
him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t. He&#8217;s to a christening at some Mexican&#8217;s
up the creek. Won&#8217;t be home till late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, morning&#8217;s as good a time as any, I reckon,
for a wedding,&#8221; said Scott, philosophically. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to stay over anyhow, to see the women off. Tomorrow&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
your train day, ain&#8217;t it? Or have you
changed your schedule?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we haven&#8217;t changed it,&#8221; replied Penhallow.
&#8220;Only we don&#8217;t run on it much. We will to-morrow,
though, because I&#8217;m sending a lot of hogs
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. Say, what do they think up here of
the revolution?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one?&#8221; with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new one. Looks like the real thing down
yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, we were looking for trouble before
the elections. We never expected the old man to keep
his hands off the ballot box and everyone knows the
man he put up&mdash;Bonillas&mdash;has got no show. It&#8217;ll be
Obregon, I s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to say. I was in Conejo a couple of days
ago and they said Sinaloa had followed Sonora and a
good many of the other states would fall in line in a
few days. Obregon&#8217;s broken away from Mexico City&mdash;guess
you heard that&mdash;and they&#8217;re talking of De la
Huerta for provisional president.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know him? De la Huerta?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him. He&#8217;s a young chap&mdash;some folks
think he&#8217;s a radical&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had any trouble at your place?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott narrated the proceedings of Juan Pachuca at
some length and with some heat. &#8220;A military guy
over in Conejo told me that he&#8217;d had orders to clean
up the state, so when Tom wised him up to the fact
that Pachuca and Angel Gonzales were doping it up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
to meet somewhere around Pachuca&#8217;s place, he sent a
troop of men down there, cut Angel off and smashed
up the whole business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get their men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got Angel, but Pachuca slid out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They let him probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Framed it up for him so&#8217;s not to hurt the feelings
of any of his high-toned friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t wonder. What time do you eat around
here, Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;ll six suit you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits me fine. I&#8217;ll go and break it to Hard that
he can&#8217;t get married till morning. I suppose this
Spanish chap won&#8217;t object to marryin&#8217; a couple of
Presbyterians? That&#8217;s what they say they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, no, the Padre&#8217;s a regular fellow,&#8221; replied
Penhallow, easily. &#8220;You give him his fee and he
ain&#8217;t going to raise no rows.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dining-room of Sam Penhallow&#8217;s hotel was a
fair-sized room with one long dinner table and three
small round ones. These latter were a concession to
the habits of certain citizens who brought their sweethearts
on the nights that Sam served chicken suppers
and who were partial to parties carrés. It was to one
of these small tables that Scott led his party. Altogether,
thanks to the efforts of Mabel and her influence
upon a certain invisible person whose identity changed
often but who was always to be identified as the
&#8220;help,&#8221; things were much better at the Commonwealth
than one had a right to expect in a town the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
size of Chula Vista. Compared to Conejo, it was like
entering into the promised land.</p>
<p>Mabel, herself, waited at table, and in the just
opinion of most of the boarders, added fifty per cent,
to the pleasure of the occasion. On this particular
night the room was full and she had the assistance of
a smiling young Mexican girl who waited on a company
of her compatriots who sat at the farthest of the
small tables. They had just ridden in&mdash;their horses
could be seen outside at the rail. The back of the
head of one of these gentlemen interested Polly immensely.
There was something about it which reminded
her strongly of Juan Pachuca.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do those Mexicans live in Chula Vista?&#8221; she
asked Mabel, under cover of a laugh at one of Hard&#8217;s
stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re strangers,&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;I think
they come from a ranch out of town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course it couldn&#8217;t be Pachuca! He was in hiding
somewhere down yonder, and yet&mdash;the party was
on her mind and she noticed it as it broke up and the
men passed out of the dining-room. She caught a
side view of the suspected one&mdash;it was Pachuca, without
a doubt. Whether he saw her or not she could
not say but if he did he avoided showing it.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s first inclination was to call Scott&#8217;s attention
to the Mexican; then she hesitated&mdash;it would mean
trouble. There would be fighting and someone would
be hurt. Scott&#8217;s back was toward them and he talked
along quite innocent of the presence of Pachuca.
While she hesitated the moment passed, the Mexicans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
were out of the room and she saw them mount their
horses and ride off. Scott and Hard were still deep
in argument. Whether Clara saw or not Polly could
not tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marc,&#8221; Polly stopped beside him as they left the
dining-room, &#8220;I&#8217;ve a nasty little headache&mdash;shall you
mind if I go to bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott, a bit surprised, replied in the negative and
Polly went on, her hand on his arm coaxingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you find out that the train goes to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have to go on it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other way that I know of for you to
go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave the property when your brother&#8217;s
away; you know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s very trying, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not what I&#8217;d like.&#8221; Scott, in spite of himself,
smiled down into the serious eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I were as big as you and didn&#8217;t like a
thing, I&#8217;d change it, that&#8217;s all. Good-night.&#8221; She ran
up the stairs.</p>
<p>Scott shrugged his shoulders and strode into the
office of the hotel; the Commonwealth boasted no parlor&mdash;guests
sat in the office or went to bed. Clara and
Hard stood near the desk talking to Penhallow. Scott
lit a cigarette and went outside. The narrow strip
of veranda was vacant. He walked moodily up and
down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>Of course, if she had a headache&mdash;but it seemed
queer to leave a fellow so early on their last evening
together for no one knew how long. Perhaps she
wouldn&#8217;t come back after all and he would wish that
he hadn&#8217;t given the old life a chance to call her and
keep her. Then he thought of the parents&mdash;never having
had any of his own as far as memory went, Scott
felt their claims strongly. He wanted the girl; wanted
her so badly that his whole being ached to take advantage
of her youth and impulsiveness; to make the
wedding in the morning a double one.</p>
<p>But Scott had not lived a hard life without learning
to do without a thing if he chose to do without it; the
thing might be a drink, it might be a horse, it might be
a woman. Still, Polly might have stayed down and
walked with him a while in the moonlight&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t
much to ask. Hard and Clara had come out, the
latter muffled in her long cloak, and were walking
down Chula Vista&#8217;s main artery toward the Padre&#8217;s
church. With a muttered exclamation, Scott dug his
hands into his pockets and went inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I can sit in the office and gab with
Sam,&#8221; he growled, but Sam had disappeared. Scott
picked up a newspaper and lit another cigarette. Suddenly,
the door opened and Clara, visibly excited, appeared,
followed by Hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Scott, what do you think? We&#8217;ve just seen
Juan Pachuca,&#8221; declared Clara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough? I suppose he could slide over the
border if he wanted to. Where&#8217;d you see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was one of those three Mexicans who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
dinner at that other small table&mdash;so Clara says,&#8221; replied
Hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your back was toward them,&#8221; went on Clara.
&#8220;Henry&#8217;s never seen him, so of course he wouldn&#8217;t
notice. I thought at the time that the man looked like
Pachuca but I didn&#8217;t get a good view of him. We
were going past that little saloon down near the church
and they came out and rode off. He pretended not to
see us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d they go?&#8221; demanded Scott, with the dryness
in his tone which always appeared when Pachuca
was mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of town&mdash;past the church. I&#8217;m going up to
tell Polly what she&#8217;s missed,&#8221; said Clara, as she ran up
the narrow little stairway. &#8220;Girls have changed&mdash;not
a doubt about it,&#8221; she thought, whimsically. &#8220;Fancy
spending the last evening they have together moping
upstairs with a headache! Wonder if anything&#8217;s
gone wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>A few moments later she was back in the office with
the two men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t find Polly,&#8221; she said, in alarm. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
to my room and to hers and she isn&#8217;t in either. Her
hat and coat are gone, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott came out of his chair with a bound. &#8220;I knew
that devil was here for no good,&#8221; he said, starting for
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, Marc Scott!&#8221; Clara&#8217;s voice was
sharp and angry. &#8220;We saw Pachuca and those two
men go off on horseback. He hasn&#8217;t carried off
Polly!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say he&#8217;d carried her off,&#8221; said Scott, doggedly.
&#8220;She sat where she could see him at dinner.
You saw him&mdash;so did she&mdash;and he saw her. This riding
off is a blind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be terribly ashamed of yourself
for what you&#8217;re saying. I know that girl. She
wouldn&#8217;t do a thing like that any more than I would.
I&#8217;m going to see Mabel Penhallow and find out what
she knows about it,&#8221; said Clara, angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find that boy and choke the life out
of him. Get out of my way, Hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Scotty, that&#8217;s not the way to handle
this affair,&#8221; remonstrated Hard, barring Scott&#8217;s
progress toward the door and speaking with a warmth
unusual to him. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get hold of Penhallow and
tell him that Pachuca&#8217;s over on this side&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need a sheriff to handle my affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t your affair, it&#8217;s the Government&#8217;s. If
this chap&#8217;s got the nerve to think he can come over
here after the way he&#8217;s acted with American property
it&#8217;s up to the Government to put him right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t find Mabel.&#8221; Clara had returned, her face
worried. &#8220;The Mexican girl said she saw an automobile
go by a quarter of an hour ago and that Polly
was in it. A Mexican was driving and she thought
there was another man in the car. Marc, he has kidnapped
her!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Scott had burst out of the room, followed by
Hard. Clara, pale and frightened, watched them from
the window. Scott&#8217;s blood was boiling. At first, stung
with a sense of injury at Polly&#8217;s treatment of him, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
had leaped to the jealous conclusion that she had seen
and communicated with Pachuca. Scott was not a
model lover. He was not of the type which believes
always until convinced by proof. He was a hot-blooded,
jealous, none too good tempered man, who
lost his head very easily when he believed himself ill-treated.
Now that he was beginning to realize that
the affair might have a different complexion&mdash;that the
girl had perhaps been overpowered and carried off&mdash;he
was furious in another way, this time against Pachuca
and against himself.</p>
<p>Mendoza had left his car outside his favorite saloon
but the car was gone and so was Mendoza.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I could trust that old greaser but I guess
I was wrong,&#8221; groaned Scott. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get horses from
the stable, Hard, and perhaps they&#8217;ll know something
about it there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investigation revealed the fact that Mendoza had
succeeded in getting his car out of town without attracting
the attention of anyone but his dish-washing
compatriot. When it leaked out that there was a kidnapping
involved, the chivalrous instincts of Chula
Vista were aroused. Horses were eagerly offered and
a posse was to be formed as soon as Sam Penhallow
could be located. Unfortunately, the only machine in
town, owned by the sheriff, had been loaned that morning
to Ed Merriam who had driven it over to the railroad
junction. In an incredibly short time, Scott and
Hard were clattering down the road which the three
Mexicans had taken half an hour before.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s useless, of course,&#8221; grunted Scott &#8220;They&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
meet the car and shake the horses before we can get to
them; but, by God, Hard, I&#8217;ll get that boy if I have to
comb New Mexico for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard was trying to be optimistic, but on a strange
horse and with a lame knee, optimism came with difficulty.
&#8220;I may be wrong, Scott,&#8221; he said, between
jolts; &#8220;but Pachuca doesn&#8217;t seem to me to be just that
kind of a scamp. He&#8217;d elope with your wife in a
second if she gave him an opportunity, but I can&#8217;t
seem to see him carrying off your sweetheart against
her will. There is such a thing as type, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Boston, maybe. Out here a man&#8217;s decent or he
ain&#8217;t,&#8221; growled the other.</p>
<p>Hard relapsed into reflection. The road they were
traveling forked at about a mile out of town. Ahead
of them, it continued on the flat; to their left it became
narrower and wound toward the foothills, remaining,
however, a road possible for a car or a wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which?&#8221; queried Hard, looking ahead as the fork
became visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;The left,&#8221; replied Scott. &#8220;They&#8217;ll hit out for
the hills. The other road goes along the railroad
tracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; muttered Hard. &#8220;I think they&#8217;ll
stick to a good road.&#8221; But Scott had spurred his
horse. Hard followed him a moment in silence, then
he called: &#8220;Scott, I hear a machine! By Jove, I see
it&mdash;it&#8217;s coming toward us, down the main road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott pulled up his horse. They peered into the
dusk ahead of them. The car was coming toward
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You brought a gun, I suppose?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Hard nodded. &#8220;What do we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold &#8217;em up.&#8221; They pulled their horses down to
a walk. &#8220;No headlights,&#8221; observed Scott. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
keep this side of that little rise. If they haven&#8217;t seen
us, they won&#8217;t see us till they&#8217;re on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t shoot, I trust, until we know who they
are,&#8221; suggested Hard, mildly. &#8220;It strikes me they&#8217;re
going the wrong way for our men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be going to turn at the fork. If it&#8217;s
not them, it&#8217;s someone who can tell us if the Mexicans
have gone this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car, a small one, pulled up the hill and started
down toward Chula Vista. Scott rode into the middle
of the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he called, authoritatively. The car
stopped. It was driven by a fat man who was its only
occupant.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you fools?&#8221; he demanded,
angrily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know this here&#8217;s the sheriff&#8217;s
car?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott lowered his gun. &#8220;That so?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Then I suppose you&#8217;ll be Ed Merriam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What business of yours is it?&#8221; replied Merriam,
disgustedly, though apparently relieved at the removal
of the weapon. Hard rode up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, only we&#8217;re out after a bunch of Mexicans
who have kidnapped a young lady,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;We thought we had them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See anything of a Ford car up the road?&#8221; demanded
Scott.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No. Say, who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or any Mexicans on horseback?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott turned to Hard. &#8220;I told you they&#8217;d taken the
other road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; demanded the fat man, excitedly.
&#8220;Is this an honest-to-gosh kidnapping? I say, it ain&#8217;t
Mabel Penhallow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it ain&#8217;t,&#8221; grunted Scott. &#8220;Will you loan us
that car for a couple of hours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet&mdash;pile in. Say, you boys give me an awful
start. I&#8217;m going to marry that girl.&#8221; Merriam wiped
his brow in relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going to marry the girl those brutes have
carried off,&#8221; replied Scott, dismounting and turning his
horse loose. Hard followed his example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t you say so at first?&#8221; demanded
Merriam, as they got into the car. &#8220;Man&#8217;s a gabby
animal, ain&#8217;t he? Which way&#8217;d they go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up in the hills, we think,&#8221; replied Hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t much of a road,&#8221; said the driver, doubtfully.
&#8220;Still, if they can make it with one car we can
with another, I reckon. Goes up Wildcat Canyon after
a bit; nobody living up there since that old Mexican
died. Say, d&#8217;you suppose they&#8217;d take her up to that
old cabin? Gosh, we&#8217;d better hit it up!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence in the rear of the car. The two
men saw in imagination the helpless girl and the tiny
remote cabin. Scott leaned forward, devouring the
road with despairing eyes. Hard sat beside him, quiet
except when he answered Merriam&#8217;s questions, sparing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
Scott, whose impatience and irritation made speech unendurable.</p>
<p>The new road led directly into the foothills. It was
narrow and very rough. The travelers were shaken
about like marbles in a boy&#8217;s pocket. Wildcat Canyon,
into which the road ran, was of a real loneliness&mdash;a
loneliness that penetrated one&#8217;s consciousness like an
odor or a sound. On either side the foothills rose,
dark and forbidding; to the left of the road a deep
arroyo ran; on the other, the slope of the hill rose
gradually to the sky line. Ahead, the hills seemed to
come together as the road became narrower and wound
in and out, becoming finally a trail. There was no
trace of habitation to be seen, though here and there
a few range cattle wandered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cabin&#8217;s about two miles up the canyon,&#8221; volunteered
Merriam. &#8220;Can&#8217;t see it from here, the road
winds too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott interrupted him suddenly. &#8220;There they are!&#8221;
he cried, pointing up the road. Three horsemen were
riding rapidly in the same direction with the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not with them, Scott,&#8221; Hard said, thankfully.</p>
<p>Scott did not answer. In his mind, he still saw the
auto with the girl in it, going toward the cabin up the
canyon. Well, at all events, Juan Pachuca would not
reach that cabin alive! Merriam threw the car into
its full speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve piped us&mdash;see &#8217;em cross the arroyo,&#8221; he
said. It was true. The three riders had plunged into
the depths of the arroyo and were out on the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
side. They did not seem to be running away, but kept
to the rapid trot which they had been riding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know who we are and aiming to give us the
idea that they&#8217;re out for a little moonlight ride,&#8221; remarked
Merriam. &#8220;This car can go, can&#8217;t she?
Sam&#8217;d sure be sore if he knew I was runnin&#8217; her
like this. Why don&#8217;t we beat it up to the cabin
and get the girl and let them mosey along by themselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we don&#8217;t know that&#8217;s where they&#8217;ve taken
her,&#8221; said Scott, angrily. He concluded that Merriam
had guessed right. Pachuca had no particular reason
to believe that the car held his enemies, or even that
Scott and Hard knew him guilty of Polly&#8217;s disappearance.
They would safeguard themselves by riding
on the other side of the arroyo but they evidently did
not intend to be scared out of their road to any further
extent.</p>
<p>The car was rapidly catching up with the riders and
soon things must come to a showdown. Scott fingered
his gun lovingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you guys, where you heading for?&#8221; demanded
Merriam, loudly, as the car came almost
abreast of the three. They turned as the machine
slowed down to their pace. Before they could answer,
Scott was out of the car and had them covered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pachuca, it&#8217;s no use&mdash;we&#8217;ve got you,&#8221; he called.
&#8220;Hands up!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two Mexicans who evidently understood little
English, though the magic words, &#8220;hands up,&#8221; probably
penetrated their darkness, glanced at Pachuca for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
orders. The latter turned his horse and rode to the
edge of the arroyo. He was his usual jaunty self, a
little travel worn, but not dulled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Scott?&#8221; he asked, peering through the dusk.
&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott paused for a moment, daunted by the other&#8217;s
impudence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want you, Pachuca,&#8221; said Hard, peremptorily.
&#8220;Come quietly and don&#8217;t force us to use our guns&mdash;we
don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca slid gracefully from his horse and took a
few steps nearer the edge. &#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;I won&#8217;t come over till I know what you
want. We&#8217;ve got our guns, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a cool one!&#8221; murmured Merriam, admiringly.
While Pachuca had drawn the attention of the Americans
by his sudden move in their direction, his two
friends had ridden up behind him and stood with their
guns ready for action. It looked like a deadlock.
Scott dropped his gun to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, put up your guns,&#8221; he said, his voice
dangerously calm. &#8220;We&#8217;ll talk it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexicans got the idea if not the words and
lowered their weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I want you for,&#8221; Scott went on,
angrily. &#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She?&#8221; Pachuca&#8217;s assumption of ignorance was
masterly. It almost convinced Hard. &#8220;Who do you
mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean Miss Street. You&#8217;ve kidnapped her or else
your friends in Mendoza&#8217;s car have and you&#8217;re on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
your way to join them. We want to know where.
Come, you can&#8217;t get away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not seen the girl since that night at Athens&mdash;yes,
I saw her to-night for a moment but I did not
speak to her. I am here on business of my own with
these gentlemen. If you have an officer of the law
with you I&#8217;ll show him my papers. If you haven&#8217;t,
I&#8217;ll go on. If you shoot, we&#8217;ll shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone would think he had papers,&#8221; murmured
Hard to Merriam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mebbe he has. They ain&#8217;t so hard to get.
What I want to know is how are we going to get him
into the car?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott tried to swallow his desire to choke the slim
youth on the other side. &#8220;Come, Pachuca,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;this won&#8217;t get you anywhere. Either tell us where
the girl is and go your way, or come over here and
fight it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where she is. As for fighting&mdash;well,
if I kill you what do I get out of it? Also, you
might quite possibly kill me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I only knew she was in the cabin, he could go
and welcome,&#8221; was rushing through Scott&#8217;s brain.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t and I mustn&#8217;t let him get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sound broke upon their ears&mdash;the sound
of an automobile. It was coming down the canyon
and coming fast. Merriam seized his horn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t have &#8217;em coming down on us in this
narrow place!&#8221; he cried, honking furiously. The
other car answered. The Mexicans turned at the
sound and Pachuca, casting a hurried glance at them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
over his shoulder, reached for his bridle. Scott raised
his gun instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay where you are!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;If those
are your people we&#8217;ll get the lot of you; if they&#8217;re not
we&#8217;ve got you, anyhow, <i>sabe</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pachuca gave one look at Scott and another at his
flying friends. Then he threw himself upon his horse&#8217;s
back, thrust the spur in deep, and as the horse reared,
drew his gun. His shot and Scott&#8217;s rang out together
as they had done once before in front of the store at
Athens&mdash;but with a different result. Pachuca reeled,
recovered, spurred the horse again and tore off in the
direction taken by the flying Mexicans; Scott stood
looking furiously at him for a moment then staggered
to the machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got me, Henry,&#8221; he muttered, as he toppled
over. &#8220;Look after the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the other machine came rumbling on through
the dusk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>TREASURE TROVE</h3>
</div>

<p>Polly Street went up to her room after leaving
Scott but she did not go to bed. Nor did she behave
in any way which suggested an alarming amount of
headache. Instead, she opened her window and looked
out. Her first glance showed Scott pacing scowlingly
up and down the narrow veranda. Further down the
street she saw Mendoza&#8217;s car parked in front of its
owner&#8217;s favorite saloon, next door, in fact, to the
butcher&#8217;s, in whose yard hung the remains of the steer&mdash;an
unhappy evidence of the truth of the adage that
in the midst of life we are in death. Mendoza was not
visible, but it needed no stretch of the imagination to
locate him.</p>
<p>With a little sigh of satisfaction, Polly withdrew her
head and remained a moment in thought; then she ran
downstairs again. A cautious peep into the office
showed Clara and Hard in conversation with Sam
Penhallow. She glided into the dining-room where
she found the good-looking Mabel finishing the clearing
off of the tables. Polly looked winningly into the
tall girl&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want awfully to speak to your father about something;
do you suppose you could get him into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
dining-room without anyone&#8217;s knowing? I want to
consult him in his official capacity,&#8221; she added with
dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Mabel, surveying her guest calmly.
&#8220;Do you mean as the sheriff or as the boss of this
hotel? Because if it&#8217;s that, you can see me. I&#8217;m the
real boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, as the sheriff, of course,&#8221; replied Polly, hastily.
&#8220;Anybody could see that you ran this hotel. It&#8217;s much
too well handled to be a man&#8217;s job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the tall girl unbent a trifle, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind
telling you that I think so myself. Of course, as a
sheriff Papa is all right. You wait here and I&#8217;ll fetch
him and look after the office till you&#8217;re through with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment or two Sam Penhallow entered the dining-room,
his good-natured face a trifle puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mabel said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>Polly smiled. &#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t she clever at managing
things? You see, Mr. Penhallow, it&#8217;s a case of &#8216;Kind
Captain, I&#8217;ve important information.&#8217; Won&#8217;t you sit
down?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, one of those Mexicans who had
dinner here to-night is Juan Pachuca&mdash;the man who
held up our mine a few days ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Why didn&#8217;t you say so before? I&#8217;d
have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think quick enough,&#8221; admitted Polly, &#8220;and
for another thing I knew that if Mr. Scott saw him
there would be trouble. He has reasons for disliking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
Pachuca&mdash;apart from the raid, at least, he thinks he
has.&#8221; Polly blushed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get you,&#8221; responded Penhallow, instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would. You seem to me like that
sort of a man. Now, I want to ask you something;
did you ever hear of a Mexican named &#8216;Gasca&#8217; who
lived around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Penhallow, a little mystified, seemed to be thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Mexican who had an Indian wife and who was
murdered?&#8221; went on Polly. Much to her disappointment,
this minute description did not seem to clear
Sam&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, that fits so many of them,&#8221; he said, apologetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wife died after he was killed,&#8221; hazarded the
girl, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on&mdash;you mean the old duffer who lived up
Wildcat Canyon?&#8221; demanded Penhallow. &#8220;Woman
had a stroke&mdash;they found her up there dead. Their
name was &#8216;Gasca&#8217; or &#8216;Gomez&#8217; or something of that
kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; Polly&#8217;s voice was triumphant. &#8220;If
I don&#8217;t make Marc Scott apologize to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Then,
calming herself, she continued: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to spin you
a yarn, Mr. Penhallow, and then you&#8217;ve got to help me
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire away,&#8221; said the gallant Penhallow and Polly
repeated as nearly as she could remember the tale that
Juan Pachuca had told her that night in Athens. Penhallow&#8217;s
eyes snapped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By gum, I bet you&#8217;re on the trail! He and those
Mexicans are looking up the stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they are, but why do they come on
horseback? They can&#8217;t carry bullion on their saddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They probably don&#8217;t more than half believe the
yarn themselves,&#8221; said Sam, meditatively. &#8220;They&#8217;re
just snooping round to see if there&#8217;s anything in it.
And automobiles ain&#8217;t so common round here that you
can pick one up every time you feel like hunting
treasure, either. I own the only one in town and I
loaned it to-day to a good-for-nothing guy that&#8217;s
courtin&#8217; Mabel, worse luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got Mendoza and his Ford,&#8221; said Polly,
eagerly. &#8220;If I run up and get my hat and coat, will
you slip down and pry him out of that saloon and the
three of us run out to Wildcat Canyon before those
Mexicans can get there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I will,&#8221; replied the willing Sam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Penhallow, you&#8217;re the kind of man that I
admire!&#8221; Polly&#8217;s eyes shone. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got imagination&mdash;it&#8217;s
the only thing Marc Scott hasn&#8217;t got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; grinned Penhallow, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry
about that if I was you; it ain&#8217;t such an awful good
quality to marry. My wife used to kick about it a
whole lot.&#8221; But Polly was gone. &#8220;I knew it!&#8221; chuckled
Sam. &#8220;I knew Scotty was meditatin&#8217; matrimony
by the way he jumped me. Fine girl, that. For ten
cents I&#8217;d give him a run for his money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faced with the alternative of driving his car or allowing
someone else to do it, Mendoza capitulated and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
allowed Penhallow to coax him out of the saloon.
They drove down the street back of the houses and
were joined by Polly who was waiting in the shadow
for them. The Mexican girl saw the car as it passed
the kitchen window, as she afterward told Clara, but
failed to recognize Penhallow who sat on the further
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we have to pass the Mexicans or can we go
another way?&#8221; asked Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can take another road and beat them to the
fork,&#8221; said Penhallow. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have the canyon
to ourselves. This way, Mendoza.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Mr. Penhallow, this gold was stolen
from one of the mines owned by our company,&#8221; said
the girl. &#8220;That&#8217;s one reason I&#8217;m so anxious to find it.
It will mean something to my brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ought to be a reward, oughtn&#8217;t there? Not
that I care about that; the excitement&#8217;s enough for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fond of excitement, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so. I&#8217;ll have to get over that, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you marry Marc Scott,&#8221; said Marc&#8217;s loyal
friend, quite forgetting his sinister intentions.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing tame about Marc. I&#8217;d hate to be the
woman who tried to fool him. She would have some
job on her hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;d have to be cleverer than I am to do it,&#8221;
sighed Polly, sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know. Say, what&#8217;s your idea of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
finding this junk, anyhow? Where d&#8217;you reckon it&#8217;d
be? Above ground?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly looked a bit taken back. &#8220;I never thought of
that,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;It&#8217;s the first time I ever hunted
treasure. Where do you think it will be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you want the truth, I ain&#8217;t looking for it
to be there at all. My idea is that Gasca got rid of it
and that&#8217;s why they killed him. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of funny the woman hung around after he
died. The natural thing would have been for her to
have gone back to her people, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it would. I know it&#8217;s there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you know it&#8217;s there it&#8217;s a pity I didn&#8217;t bring
along a couple of pickaxes,&#8221; said Sam, with a grin.
&#8220;All the treasures I ever heard about called for pickaxes,
skeletons and an old family chart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, have it your own way!&#8221; said the aggravated
Polly. &#8220;But who, I&#8217;d like to know, would have come
up to this lonely place to look for gold, and how could
an ignorant old Mexican like Gasca dispose of it without
getting into trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mebbe so. Anyhow, here&#8217;s your cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cabin was situated up the canyon on the right
hand side of the road. It was a little wooden shack,
sagging and discolored, its windows broken and its
whole appearance denoting that utter desolation to
which only a deserted homestead can attain; not even
a human wreck can equal this silent abandonment. It
had been a fairly decent place once; there were outbuildings
which evidenced past association with pigs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
and chickens, while back of the house stood a wooden
cart such as country people use for hauling wood or
hay.</p>
<p>In the dusk, that saddest of sad times, between sunset
and moonrise, Wildcat Canyon presented an awesome
appearance. The hills were outlined sharply and
darkly against the sky; the little stream that dribbled
past the cabin was so quiet that it seemed the ghost of
water; there was no movement&mdash;no sound&mdash;no suggestion
of life.</p>
<p>Polly drew a long breath. &#8220;What a dreadful place
to live!&#8221; she murmured, her spirits dashed for a moment.
A woman had lived here&mdash;a woman stolen
from her people. Had lived&mdash;and, stricken and alone,
had died here. Polly thought of her own spoiled and
sheltered life and her eyes filled.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sam Penhallow took in the view
with intense disfavor. &#8220;I never was partial to Wildcat
Canyon,&#8221; he remarked, pessimistically. &#8220;I caught
a cattle thief up here once. He hid behind that rock
and gave us a real nasty time before we got him. Well,
since we&#8217;re here we may as well get busy. Can&#8217;t you
get us a little nearer, Mendoza? This is pretty far to
tote gold bars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, laugh if you want to,&#8221; said Polly, indulgently.
&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve seen the place I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say this,&#8221; remarked Penhallow, &#8220;if I had anything
I wanted to hide and didn&#8217;t want any fools
blunderin&#8217; into, I couldn&#8217;t pick a likelier place to hide
it in than this one&mdash;whether it was gold or a body.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mendoza ran them within a few yards of the hut and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
they got out. Gasca&#8217;s late residence did not improve
on closer inspection. The door hung loosely on its
hinges and once within, its dark recesses suggested
many things not altogether pleasant. There was little
furniture and that broken and poor; the hut boasted
two rooms and the floor was merely the ground. There
was nothing to suggest hidden treasure, and no place
where it could be secreted as far as the visitors could
see. Even the fireplace yielded no secrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;How stupid of us!&#8221; declared Polly, determined
not to be discouraged. &#8220;Of course it wouldn&#8217;t be in
here or they would have found it when they took the
poor woman away. Let&#8217;s go outside and think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My idea is that it&#8217;s either buried or they got rid
of it,&#8221; said Penhallow, promptly. It had suddenly occurred
to him that Mendoza was a poor chaperon for a
good-looking widower&mdash;not old&mdash;and a pretty girl engaged
to Marc Scott. It was a disturbing idea, for
Sam was of a conventional turn of mind. &#8220;If he&#8217;s
buried it, we&#8217;ll have to dig all over the place, and I take
it none of us is much on the dig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, I&#8217;ve got an idea myself,&#8221; said
Polly, with dignity. &#8220;You look in the chicken-house
and I&#8217;ll take a peep into the shed in the corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam shrugged his shoulders and started for the
chicken-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott&#8217;s gettin&#8217; his match all right,&#8221; he muttered,
rebelliously. &#8220;Goin&#8217; to make him toe the chalk line,
that girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Penhallow, come here!&#8221; Polly&#8217;s voice was
shrill and excited. &#8220;Come here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Comin&#8217;, lady. Did you find it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here.&#8221; Polly was at the side of an old cart,
peering and poking through the sticks of wood and
bits of old straw which filled it. &#8220;See, down there&mdash;doesn&#8217;t
that look to you like something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Penhallow felt a sudden thrill; a thrill he had
not known the like of since he led the posse across the
border after the kidnapping bandit. He bent an excited
gray eye over the hole indicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure does look like there was somethin&#8217; besides
wood in there&mdash;somethin&#8217; bulky, and there&#8217;s some
sacking.&mdash;Hi, Mendoza, come here and lend a
hand!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime he and Polly began throwing the
wood out of the wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;My idea is that Gasca hid it in the wagon because
he thought no one would suspect anything there,&#8221; said
Polly, &#8220;and he could haul it away in a hurry if they
did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more likely he buried it and after he died the
woman dug it up and packed it in here meaning to go
South with it and then got sick and died before she had
the chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I said you had imagination. That&#8217;s a much
better theory than mine,&#8221; said Polly, generously.
&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t somebody take the wagon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it ain&#8217;t much of a wagon. I reckon they
took the horse and the pigs and chickens and let the
rest slide. The wood don&#8217;t amount to much; just
sticks she&#8217;s picked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mendoza, quite of the opinion that the couple whom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
up to this time he had suspected of nothing more
alarming than an elopement, had suddenly gone very
mad, stolidly chucked wood out of the wagon lest a
worse thing be demanded of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; The three gathered around the half-empty
wagon in excitement, even Mendoza manifesting
a slight degree of zest when through the layer of straw,
half covered with sacking, was revealed a number of
rough looking blocks, in shape resembling large loaves
of bread. Penhallow lifted one with difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is, girl,&#8221; he cried, his eyes glistening.
&#8220;It&#8217;s gold straight from the mine. Why, what&#8217;s the
matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so disappointing,&#8221; murmured the girl; &#8220;it looks
like old junk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s pretty good old junk. I only wish it was
mine, don&#8217;t you, Mendoza? This stuff, Mendoza, all
belongs to some rich guys who own a lot of mines
down yonder. Big, fat chaps who sit in easy chairs
back of mahogany tables and let other fellows earn
their money for them; fine business, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mendoza grinned&mdash;a comprehending if not a lovely
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si</i>,&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;I seen them fat fellers up in
San Antone. All got de sickness of de kidney or de
stomach. Me, I rather be poor man and live on de
outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that ain&#8217;t bad for an old heathen, eh, Miss
Polly?&#8221; chuckled Penhallow. &#8220;Come on, we&#8217;ve got
to load this stuff into the Ford before those greasers
get here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you think there is?&#8221; asked Polly,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;a few thousands, I guess. I&#8217;ve
a notion old Gasca had to whack up with the fellows
who helped him get it across. It&#8217;s no fortune but it&#8217;s
going to give us lame backs moving it and I reckon
the Company will be glad to see it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a hard load to move and long before the
transfer was made Polly acknowledged that she was
glad they hadn&#8217;t made a bigger haul. It was growing
darker, too, and Wildcat Canyon began to seem less
and less the sort of place for a picnic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, little lady,&#8221; observed Penhallow, as they
started down the canyon, &#8220;you&#8217;ve done a good
night&#8217;s work for your brother. Say, Mendoza, don&#8217;t
that look like a car to you down yonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly sat up suddenly. &#8220;I thought you said that
you owned the only car in town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve a notion that that&#8217;s mine,
though why Ed Merriam should be flourishin&#8217; it around
here, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Car, yes,&#8221; agreed Mendoza. &#8220;Make &#8217;em back
up. Can&#8217;t pass there.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same moment the other car honked excitedly
and Mendoza answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some men on horseback there, aren&#8217;t
there?&#8221; said Polly, straining her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the other side of the arroyo&mdash;yes. Hullo,
guns! Say, Ed&#8217;s in trouble! Shake a leg, Mendoza&mdash;we
got to look into this. Girlie, you can lie down if
they shoot, do you hear?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; breathed Polly, excitedly.</p>
<p>They could see plainly now. They saw two of the
mounted men dash off and the other, reeling in his
saddle, but holding gamely to his seat, dash after them.
Then they saw two men from the automobile spring
to support the third who had fallen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, I hope that ain&#8217;t Ed!&#8221; said Penhallow. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like the guy much, but Mabel would have my
blood if I let him get plugged and me on the spot doing
nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Merriam,&#8221; said Mendoza, darkly. &#8220;Merriam
and Señor Hard carry the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; But Penhallow was too slow. The
car was slowing down and Polly was out in the road.
Penhallow followed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is he killed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard looked up from his task of reviving Scott,
with the contents of his whiskey flask and saw to his
amazement a white-faced Polly Street bending over
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Then they didn&#8217;t get you,
after all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he killed?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s voice was sharp and
hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he ain&#8217;t,&#8221; Penhallow&#8217;s hearty voice broke in.
&#8220;It takes more than one bullet to kill a tough bird like
Scotty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marc opened his eyes, grinned feebly and shut them
again, not before he had seen Polly&#8217;s anxious face
bending over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&mdash;Pachuca didn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it, old man,&#8221; Hard broke in. Then
to Polly: &#8220;We thought Pachuca had carried you off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly stared at him in horror. &#8220;Carried me off?&#8221;
she gasped. &#8220;Were those men&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she paused,
dazed. Hard explained.</p>
<p>Sam Penhallow in the meantime had tackled his
prospective son-in-law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d they get him, Ed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoulder. Don&#8217;t look to me like no vital spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we ain&#8217;t all got our vitals as protected as
you have, Ed,&#8221; replied the sheriff, scathingly. &#8220;What
was you up here for, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott got it into his head that his girl had been
kidnapped by Mexicans and he got us up here after
three of &#8217;em. Looks to me, Father-in-law, like he&#8217;d
picked the wrong kidnapper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do, Ed; fat folks was made to look funny,
not to talk smart. Here, let&#8217;s get this boy bandaged
up before he bleeds to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly, white and frightened, looked on as Penhallow&#8217;s
experienced hands tore up a shirt and made it
into a bandage. The wound looked very vital to her
and she would have given up hope a dozen times if
it hadn&#8217;t been for Penhallow&#8217;s cheerful monologue.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea! Say, you boys better guess what
this girl and I got in that Ford. We&#8217;ve been after
treasure. Oh, you&#8217;re waking up, are you?&#8221; as Scott
opened his eyes. &#8220;I thought you would. You won&#8217;t
josh your wife much about Gasca and his hidden gold,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all my fault,&#8221; wept the girl. &#8220;If I&#8217;d only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
told you where I was going this wouldn&#8217;t have happened.
Oh, Marc, I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you ain&#8217;t the only one that&#8217;s sorry, I reckon,&#8221;
grinned Merriam. &#8220;That Mexican ain&#8217;t going to do
much ridin&#8217; for a while by the looks of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; Penhallow and Hard lifted Scott
gently into the car. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about him. He&#8217;s
had this coming to him for some time by all accounts
and the worst of it is his hide&#8217;s probably so tough he
won&#8217;t know it&#8217;s been punctured.&#8221; Penhallow spat
disgustedly.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The return of the two cars, the one with the treasure
and the other with the missing girl, made a sensation
quite after Chula Vista&#8217;s own heart. When it became
known that the doctor had pronounced Scott&#8217;s wound
not dangerous but requiring care and quiet, the situation
was all that could be desired. They would have
been happier still could they have heard Polly&#8217;s ultimatum,
delivered the following morning when she and
Scott were alone together a few minutes before Clara&#8217;s
wedding. Scott had insisted that the wedding should
not be postponed for even a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re needed in Athens, Hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With
Bob and me both in the discard, you&#8217;ve got to stand
by the ship.&#8221; So the wedding had been set for ten
o&#8217;clock, Polly&#8217;s train leaving for the railroad junction
at noon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Marc, listen to me,&#8221; Polly said. Her tone
was severe. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been really stern with you
since our acquaintance. I&#8217;ve always given in and let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
you have the biggest piece of cake. Now I mean
what I say. I&#8217;m not going back and leave you here,
sick and alone. Besides, Mrs. Conrad changed her
mind last night. She&#8217;s going to Athens with Mr.
Hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Mabel Penhallow&mdash;she&#8217;d look after me,&#8221;
replied Scott, mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she shan&#8217;t. Let her look after that fat thing
she&#8217;s going to marry. No, I&#8217;m going to stay here until
you&#8217;re well again, and by that time my reputation will
be in shreds&mdash;perfect shreds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think it will, too, but what can I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can let me tell that minister to come right over
here and marry us when he&#8217;s through with the others,&#8221;
said Polly, firmly. Then, with tears in her eyes: &#8220;Oh,
Marc, don&#8217;t you see I don&#8217;t like doing underhand
things any more than you do, but I can&#8217;t go away and
leave you like this? I know my people and I know
what they&#8217;ll say. They&#8217;ll say I did the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, girlie, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I&#8217;d rather like to see
Hard and Mrs. Conrad married, myself. Don&#8217;t you
think maybe you could get the Padre to do both jobs
over here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it was that a double wedding took place in the
small room which the invalid occupied. Chula Vista,
or at least those citizens who were allowed to witness
the ceremony, were loud in their praises of the brides.
Ed Merriam was particularly impressed and begged
earnestly that it might be made a triple affair, but, as
Mr. Penhallow justly observed, you can overdo even a
good thing if you try hard enough. Ed was obliged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
to content himself with the rôle of spectator. Mr.
Penhallow, himself, was a busy man. He not only
acted as best man at both ceremonies, but he also had
the gold on his nerves. It was removed immediately
after the weddings&mdash;in the first spare moment that the
best man had&mdash;to a near-by town which possessed banking
facilities, a full account of its recovery being sent
to Robert Street. This arrived in the same mail with
a letter from Polly, and Bob celebrated his first sitting
up by breaking the news to his parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you what, folks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;while it&#8217;s a bit
of a blow to have our baby cut loose like this, there&#8217;s
something to be said on the other side. Marc Scott&#8217;s
a first-class fellow and he&#8217;ll make her a much better
husband than that Henderson chap ever would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Bob dear, what sort of a man is he?&#8221; Mrs.
Street&#8217;s delicate face expressed alarm neatly blended
with horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; replied her husband, briefly, &#8220;is what I am
going to find out. There&#8217;s a train going west in about
two hours and if you wish me to carry your blessing
to our wayward child I shall be happy to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hard went south in Mendoza&#8217;s Ford.
Theirs was a gentle romance, with more poetry in it
than the bride suspected. Two people so thoroughly
suited to each other do not always have the happiness
to meet at just the right time.</p>
<p>&#8220;For it is just the right time, Clara,&#8221; Hard said.
&#8220;A little earlier and we might not have had the wisdom
to fall in love again with each other; a little later
and we might have felt too old and dignified to think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
of it. I consider that we took things in the nick of
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The success of the revolution, which resulted in the
presidency of Alvaro Obregon, made popular a movement
against the bandits which have flourished so long
in Mexico. The case of Angel Gonzales was handled
early one morning by a firing squad in the courtyard
of Juan Pachuca&#8217;s country residence. The evidence
against Angel was cumulative, the episode of the Yaqui
village being only one of many interesting exploits in
which he had figured.</p>
<p>Just how much the escape of Juan Pachuca was due
to the connivance of his captors will probably never be
known. The general opinion, however, was that while
his misdeeds were not to be condoned, in view of the
friendly sentiments on the part of the new Government
toward the United States; at the same time they were
considered hardly of a nature to subject a gentleman
to the fate of a bandit. Cared for by his friends on
the other side while his wound was healing, Pachuca
is still living peacefully and very quietly on our side
of the border, waiting, probably, the opportunity to
return to his country to help along another revolution.</p>
<p>Scott and Polly will be happy. They are happy
at present, and are no longer at Athens; the Fiske,
Doane Co. having appointed Scott to a better position
in one of its Arizona mines, a delicate compliment,
he says, to his wife&#8217;s services in the little matter
of the Gasca treasure.</p>
